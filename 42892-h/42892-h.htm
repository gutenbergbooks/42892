<h2><a name="PREFACE" id="PREFACE">PREFACE.</a></h2>


<p>Mr. Dana wrote these Recollections of the civil
war according to a purpose which he had entertained
for several years. They were completed only a few
months before his death on October 17, 1897. A
large part of the narrative has been published serially
in McClure's Magazine. In the chapter about Abraham
Lincoln and the Lincoln Cabinet Mr. Dana has
drawn from a lecture which he delivered in 1896 before
the New Haven Colony Historical Society. The
incident of the self-wounded spy, in the chapter relating
to the secret service of the war, was first printed
in the North American Review for August, 1891. A
few of the anecdotes about Mr. Lincoln which appear
in this book were told by Mr. Dana originally in a
brief contribution to a volume entitled Reminiscences
of Abraham Lincoln by Distinguished Men of his
Time, edited by the late Allen Thorndike Rice, and
published in 1886.</p>

<p>Although Mr. Dana was in one sense the least
reminiscent of men, living actively in the present, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[Pg vi]</a></span>
always more interested in to-morrow than in yesterday,
and although it was his characteristic habit to
toss into the wastebasket documents for history which
many persons would have treasured, he found in the
preparation of the following chapters abundant material
wherewith to stimulate and confirm his own memory,
in the form of his official and unofficial reports
written at the front for the information of Mr. Stanton
and Mr. Lincoln, and private letters to members
of his family and intimate friends.</p>

<p>Charles Anderson Dana was forty-four years old
when his appointment as Assistant Secretary of War
put him behind the scenes of the great drama then enacting,
and brought him into personal relations with
the conspicuous civilians and soldiers of the war period.
Born in New Hampshire on August 8, 1819, he had
passed by way of western New York, Harvard College,
and Brook Farm into the profession which he loved
and in which he labored almost to the last day of his
life. When Secretary Stanton called him to Washington
he had been engaged for nearly fifteen years in the
management of the New York Tribune, the journal
most powerful at that time in solidifying Northern
sentiment for the crisis that was to come. When the
war was over and the Union preserved, he returned
at once to journalism. His career subsequently as the
editor of The Sun for thirty years is familiar to most
Americans.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vii" id="Page_vii">[Pg vii]</a></span></p>

<p>It is proper to note the circumstance that the
three years covered by Mr. Dana's Recollections as
here recorded constitute the only term during which
he held any public office, and the only break in more
than half a century of continuous experience in the
making of newspapers. His connection with the Government
during those momentous years is an episode
in the story of a life that throbbed from boyhood to
age with intellectual energy, and was crowded with
practical achievement.</p>

<p>I had been associated with Horace Greeley on the
New York Tribune for about fifteen years when, one
morning early in April, 1862, Mr. Sinclair, the advertising
manager of the paper, came to me, saying that
Mr. Greeley would be glad to have me resign. I asked
one of my associates to find from Mr. Greeley if that
was really his wish. In a few hours he came to me saying
that I had better go. I stayed the day out in order
to make up the paper and give them an opportunity
to find a successor, but I never went into the office
after that. I think I then owned a fifth of the paper&mdash;twenty
shares; this stock my colleagues bought.</p>

<p>Mr. Greeley never gave a reason for dismissing me,
nor did I ever ask for one. I know, though, that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span>
real explanation was that while he was for peace I was
for war, and that as long as I stayed on the Tribune
there was a spirit there which was not his spirit&mdash;that
he did not like.</p>

<p>My retirement from the Tribune was talked of in the
newspapers for a day or two, and brought me a letter
from the Secretary of War, Edwin M. Stanton, saying
he would like to employ me in the War Department.
I had already met Mr. Lincoln, and had carried on a
brief correspondence with Mr. Stanton. My meeting
with Mr. Lincoln was shortly after his inauguration.
He had appointed Mr. Seward to be his Secretary of
State, and some of the Republican leaders of New York
who had been instrumental in preventing Mr. Seward's
nomination to the presidency, and in securing that of
Mr. Lincoln, had begun to fear that they would be
left out in the cold in the distribution of the offices.
General James S. Wadsworth, George Opdyke, Lucius
Robinson, T. B. Carroll, and Henry B. Stanton were
among the number of these gentlemen. Their apprehensions
were somewhat mitigated by the fact that Mr.
Chase, to whom we were all friendly, was Secretary of
the Treasury. But, notwithstanding, they were afraid
that the superior tact and pertinacity of Mr. Seward
and of Mr. Thurlow Weed, Seward's close friend and
political manager, would get the upper hand, and that
the power of the Federal administration would be put
into the control of the rival faction; accordingly, several
of them determined to go to Washington, and I was
asked to go with them.</p>

<p>I believe the appointment for our interview with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span>
the President was made through Mr. Chase; but at any
rate we all went up to the White House together, except
Mr. Henry B. Stanton, who stayed away because
he was himself an applicant for office.</p>

<p>Mr. Lincoln received us in the large room upstairs
in the east wing of the White House, where he had his
working office. The President stood up while General
Wadsworth, who was our principal spokesman, and
Mr. Opdyke stated what was desired. After the interview
had begun, a big Indianian, who was a messenger
in attendance in the White House, came into the room
and said to the President:</p>

<p>"She wants you."</p>

<p>"Yes, yes," said Mr. Lincoln, without stirring.</p>

<p>Soon afterward the messenger returned again, exclaiming,
"I say, she wants you!"</p>

<p>The President was evidently annoyed, but instead of
going out after the messenger he remarked to us:</p>

<p>"One side shall not gobble up everything. Make
out a list of places and men you want, and I will endeavor
to apply the rule of give and take."</p>

<p>General Wadsworth answered:</p>

<p>"Our party will not be able to remain in Washington,
but we will leave such a list with Mr. Carroll, and
whatever he agrees to will be agreeable to us."</p>

<p>Mr. Lincoln continued: "Let Mr. Carroll come in
to-morrow, and we will see what can be done."</p>

<p>This is the substance of the interview, and what
most impressed me was the evident fairness of the President.
We all felt that he meant to do what was right
and square in the matter. While he was not the man<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
to promote factious quarrels and difficulties within his
party, he did not intend to leave in the lurch the friends
through whose exertions his nomination and election
had finally been brought about. At the same time he
understood perfectly that we of New York and our
associates in the Republican body had not gone to
Chicago for the purpose of nominating him, or of
nominating any one in particular, but only to beat Mr.
Seward, and thereupon to do the best that could be
done as regards the selection of the candidate.</p>

<p>My acquaintance with Mr. Stanton had come about
through an editorial which I had written for the Tribune
on his entrance to the War Department. I had
sent it to him with a letter calling his attention to certain
facts with which it seemed to me the War Department
ought to deal. In reply I received the following
letter:</p>

<div class='letter'>

<p class='nr5right'>
<span class="smcap">Washington</span>, <i class='date'>January 24, 1862</i>.
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">My dear Sir</span>: Yours of the 22d only reached me
this evening. The facts you mention were new to me,
but there is too much reason to fear they are true. But
that matter will, I think, be corrected <em>very speedily</em>.</p>

<p>You can not tell how much obligation I feel myself
under for your kindness. Every man who wishes the
country to pass through this trying hour should stand
on watch, and aid me. Bad passions and little passions
and mean passions gather around and hem in the great
movements that should deliver this nation.</p>

<p>Two days ago I wrote you a long letter&mdash;a three
pager&mdash;expressing my thanks for your admirable article
of the 21st, stating my position and purposes; and in
that letter I mentioned some of the circumstances of
my unexpected appointment. But, interrupted before
it was completed, I will not inflict, or afflict, you with it.</p>

<p>I know the task that is before us&mdash;I say <em>us</em>, because
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>the Tribune has its mission as plainly as I have mine,
and they tend to the same end. But I am not in the
smallest degree dismayed or disheartened. By God's
blessing we shall prevail. I feel a deep, <em>earnest</em> feeling
growing up around me. We have no jokes or trivialities,
but all with whom I act show that they are now in
dead earnest.</p>

<p>I know you will rejoice to know this.</p>

<p>As soon as I can get the machinery of the office
working, the rats cleared out, and the rat holes stopped
we shall <em>move</em>. This army has got to fight or run away;
and while men are striving nobly in the West, the
champagne and oysters on the Potomac must be
stopped. But patience for a short while only is all I ask,
if you and others like you will rally around me.</p>

<p class='center'>
Yours truly,</p>

<p class='nr5right'><span class="smcap">Edwin M. Stanton</span>.</p>

<p class='nr3left'><span class="smcap">C. A. Dana</span>, Esq.
</p></div>

<p>A few days after this I wrote Mr. Stanton a second
letter, in which I asked him to give General Fr√©mont a
chance. At the breaking out of the war Fr√©mont had
been made a major general in the regular army and
the command of the Western Department had been
given to him. His campaign in Missouri in the summer
of 1861 gave great dissatisfaction, and in November,
1861, he was relieved, after an investigation by the Secretary
of War. Since that time he had been without a
command. I believed, as did many others, that political
intrigue was keeping Fr√©mont back. I was anxious
that he should have fair play, in order that the great
mass of people who had supported him for the presidency
in 1856, and who still were his warm friends,
might not be dissatisfied. To my letter Mr. Stanton
replied:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span></p>

<div class='letter'>

<p class='nr5right'>
<span class="smcap">Washington</span>, <i class='date'>February 1, 1862</i>.
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>: If General Fr√©mont has any fight in him,
he shall (so far as I am concerned) have a chance to
show it, and I have told <em>him</em> so. The times require the
help of every man according to his gifts, and, having
neither partialities nor grudges to indulge, it will be
my aim to practice on the maxim, "the tools to him
that can handle them."<a name="FNanchor_A_1" id="FNanchor_A_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_1" class="fnanchor">[A]</a></p>

<p>There will be serious trouble between Hunter and
Lane. What Lane's expedition has in view, how it
came to be set on foot, and what is expected to be accomplished
by it, I do not know and have tried in
vain to find out. It seems to be a haphazard affair that
no one will admit himself to be responsible for. But
believing that Lane has pluck, and is an earnest man, he
<em>shall have fair play</em>. If you know anything about him
or his expedition pray tell it to me.</p>

<p>To bring the War Department up to the standard
of the times, and work an army of five hundred thousand
with machinery adapted to a peace establishment
of twelve thousand, is no easy task. This was Mr.
Cameron's great trouble, and the cause of much of
the complaints against him. All I ask is reasonable
time and patience. The pressure of members of Congress
for clerk and army appointments, notwithstanding
the most stringent rules, and the persistent strain
against all measures essential to obtain time for thought,
combination, and conference, is discouraging in the extreme&mdash;it
often tempts me to quit the helm in despair.
The only consolation is the confidence and support of
good and patriotic men; to their aid I look for strength.</p>

<p class='nr5right'>
Yours truly,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span class="smcap">Edwin M. Stanton</span>.</p>
<p class='nr3left'>
<span class="smcap">C. A. Dana</span>, Esq., Tribune Office.
</p></div>

<p>Very soon after Mr. Stanton went into office military
affairs were energized, and a forward movement<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
of the armies was apparent. It was followed by several
victories, notably those of Fort Henry and Fort Donelson.
On several occasions the Tribune credited to the
head of the War Department this new spirit which
seemed to inspire officers and men. Mr. Stanton, fearful
of the effect of this praise, sent to the paper the following
dispatch:</p>

<div class='letter'>

<p>
<em>To the Editor of the New York Tribune:</em>
</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Sir</span>: I can not suffer undue merit to be ascribed to
my official action. The glory of our recent victories belongs
to the gallant officers and soldiers that fought the
battles. No share of it belongs to me.</p>

<p>Much has recently been said of military combinations
and organizing victory. I hear such phrases with
apprehension. They commenced in infidel France with
the Italian campaign, and resulted in Waterloo. Who
can organize victory? Who can combine the elements
of success on the battlefield? We owe our recent victories
to the spirit of the Lord that moved our soldiers
to rush into battle and filled the heart of our enemies
with dismay. The inspiration that conquered in battle
was in the hearts of the soldiers and from on high; and
wherever there is the same inspiration there will be
the same results. Patriotic spirit, with resolute courage
in officers and men, is a military combination that never
failed.</p>

<p>We may well rejoice at the recent victories, for they
teach us that battles are to be won now and by us in
the same and only manner that they were ever won by
any people, or in any age, since the days of Joshua, by
boldly pursuing and striking the foe. What, under the
blessing of Providence, I conceive to be the true organization
of victory and military combination to end this
war, was declared in a few words by General Grant's
message to General Buckner: "<em>I propose to move immediately
on your works.</em>"</p>

<p class='nr5right'>
Yours truly,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span class="smcap">Edwin M. Stanton</span>.
</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span></p>

<p>On receiving this I at once wired to our representative
in Washington to know if Mr. Stanton meant to
"repudiate" the Tribune. I received my answer from
Mr. Stanton himself:</p>

<div class='letter'>

<p class='nr5right'>
<span class="smcap">Washington</span>, <i class='date'>February 19, 1862</i>.
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>: It occurred to me that your kind notice
of myself might be perverted into a disparagement of
the Western officers and soldiers to whom the merit of
the recent victories justly belongs, and that it might
create an antagonism between them and the head of the
War Department. To avoid <em>that</em> misconstruction was
the object of my dispatch&mdash;leaving the matter to be
determined as to publication to the better judgment of
the Tribune, my own mind not being clear on the point
of its expediency. Mr. Hill called to see me this evening,
and from the tenor of your dispatch it seemed to
me that your judgment did not approve the publication,
or you would not speak of me as "repudiating" anything
the Tribune says. On reflection <em>I am convinced
the communication should not be published</em>, as it might
imply an antagonism between myself and the Tribune.
On this, as on any future occasion, I defer to your
judgment. We have one heart and mind in this great
cause, and upon many essential points you have a wider
range of observation and clearer sight than myself; I
am therefore willing to be guided by your wisdom.</p>

<p class='nr5right'>
Yours truly,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span class="smcap">Edwin M. Stanton</span>.</p>

<p class='nr3left'><span class="smcap">C. A. Dana</span>, Esq.
</p></div>

<p>On receiving this letter we of course published his
telegram at once.</p>

<p>When Mr. Stanton went into the War Department
there was great dissatisfaction in the Tribune office with
McClellan. He had been placed in command of the
Army of the Potomac in the preceding August, and
since November 1st had been in command of all the
armies of the United States; but while he had proved<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
himself an excellent drillmaster, he had at the same time
proved that he was no general at all. His friends were
loyal, however, and whatever success our armies met
with was attributed to his generalship.</p>

<p>When the capture of Fort Donelson was announced,
McClellan's friends claimed that he had directed it by
telegraph from his headquarters on the Potomac. Now
the terminus of the telegraph toward Fort Donelson
was many miles from the battlefield. Besides, the absurdity
of a general directing the movements of a battle
a thousand miles off, even if he had fifty telegraph wires
leading to every part of the field, was apparent. Nevertheless,
McClellan's supporters kept up their claim. On
February 20th the Associated Press agent at Washington,
in reporting a railroad convention in Washington
at which Mr. Stanton had spoken, said:</p>

<p>"Secretary Stanton in the course of his address paid
a high compliment to the young and gallant friend at
his side, Major-General McClellan, in whom he had the
utmost confidence, and the results of whose military
schemes, gigantic and well matured, were now exhibited
to a rejoicing country. The Secretary, with upraised
hands, implored Almighty God to aid them and
himself, and all occupying positions under the Government,
in crushing out this unholy rebellion."</p>

<p>I did not believe Stanton had done any such thing, so
I sent the paragraph to him. The Secretary replied:</p>

<div class='letter'>

<p>
[Private.]</p>

<p class='nr5right'><span class="smcap">Washington</span>, <i class='date'>February 23, 1862</i>.
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>: The paragraph to which you called my
attention was a ridiculous and impudently impertinent
effort to puff the general by a false publication of words
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>I never uttered. Sam Barlow, one of the secretaries of
the meeting, was its author, as I have been informed.
It is too small a matter for <em>me</em> to contradict, but I told
Mr. Kimlen, the other secretary, that I thought the
gentlemen who invited me to be present at their meeting
owed it to themselves to see that one of their own
officers should not misrepresent what I said. It was for
them, and due to their own honor, to see that an officer
of the Government might communicate with them in
safety; and if it was not done, I should take care to
afford no other opportunity for such practices.</p>

<p>The fact is that the agents of the Associated Press
and a gang around the Federal Capitol appear to be
organized for the purpose of magnifying their idol.</p>

<p>And if such men as those who composed the railroad
convention in this city do not rebuke such a practice
as that perpetrated in this instance, they can not be
conferred with in future.</p>

<p>You will of course see the propriety of my not noticing
the matter and thereby giving it importance beyond
the contempt it inspires. I think you are well enough
acquainted with me to judge in future the value of any
such statement.</p>

<p>I notice the Herald telegraphic reporter announces
that I had a second attack of illness on Friday and
could not attend the department. I was in the department,
or in the Cabinet, from nine in the morning
until nine at night, and never enjoyed more perfect
health than on that day and at present.</p>

<p>For <em>your</em> kind solicitude accept my thanks. I shall
not needlessly impair my means of usefulness.</p>

<p class='nr5right'>
Yours truly,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span class="smcap">Edwin M. Stanton</span>.</p>

<p class='nr3left'><span class="smcap">C. A. Dana</span>, Esq.
</p>

<p>P.S.&mdash;Was it not a funny sight to see a certain
military hero in the telegraph office at Washington last
Sunday organizing victory, and by sublime military
combinations capturing Fort Donelson <em>six hours after</em>
Grant and Smith had taken it sword in hand and had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
victorious possession! It would be a picture worthy of
Punch.</p></div>

<p>Thus, when the newspapers announced my unexpected
retirement from the Tribune, I was not unknown
to either the President or the Secretary of War.</p>

<p>To Mr. Stanton's letter asking me to go into the
service of the War Department, I replied that I would
attempt anything he wanted me to do, and in May he
wrote me that I was to be appointed on a commission
to audit unsettled claims against the quartermaster's
department at Cairo, Ill. I was directed to be in Cairo
on June 17th. My formal appointment, which I did
not receive until after I reached Cairo, read thus:</p>

<div class='letter'>

<p class='nr9right'>
<span class="smcap">War Department</span>,</p>
<p class='nr5right'><span class="smcap">Washington City, D.C.</span>, <i class='date'>June 16, 1862</i>.
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir</span>: By direction of the President, a commission
has been appointed, consisting of Messrs. George S.
Boutwell, Stephen T. Logan, and yourself, to examine
and report upon all unsettled claims against the War
Department, at Cairo, Ill., that may have originated
prior to the first day of April, 1862.</p>

<p>Messrs. Boutwell and Logan have been requested to
meet with you at Cairo on the eighteenth day of June
instant, in order that the commission may be organized
on that day and enter immediately upon the discharge
of its duties.</p>

<p>You will be allowed a compensation of eight dollars
per day and mileage.</p>

<p>Mr. Thomas Means, who has been appointed solicitor
for the Government, has been directed to meet
you at Cairo on the eighteenth instant, and will act,
under the direction of the commission, in the investigation
of such claims as may be presented.</p>

<p class='nr9right'>
<span class="smcap">Edwin M. Stanton</span>,</p>
<p class='nr5right'><i class='title'>Secretary of War</i>.</p>

<p class='nr3left'>
Hon. <span class="smcap">Charles A. Dana</span>, of New York,</p>
<p class='nr9left'>Cairo, Ill.
</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span></p>

<p>On reaching Cairo on the appointed day, I found
my associates, Judge Logan, of Springfield, Ill., one
of Mr. Lincoln's friends, and Mr. Boutwell, of Massachusetts,
afterward Governor of his State, Secretary of
the Treasury, and a United States senator. We organized
on the 18th, as directed. Two days after we met
Judge Logan was compelled by illness to resign from
the commission, and Shelby M. Cullom, now United
States senator from Illinois, was appointed in his place.</p>

<p>The main Union armies had by this time advanced
far to the front, but Cairo was still an important military
depot, almost an outpost, in command of General
William K. Strong, whom I had known well in New
York as a politician. There was a large number of
troops stationed in the town, and from there the armies
on the Mississippi River, in Missouri, and in Kentucky,
got all their supplies and munitions of war. The quartermaster's
department at Cairo had been organized
hastily, and the demands upon it had increased rapidly.
Much of the business had been done by green volunteer
officers who did not understand the technical duties of
making out military requisitions and returns. The result
was that the accounts were in great confusion, and
hysterical newspapers were charging the department
with fraud and corruption. The War Department decided
to make a full investigation of all disbursements
at Cairo from the beginning. Little actual cash had
thus far been paid out upon contracts, and it was not
too late to correct overcharges and straighten out the
system. The matter could not be settled by any ordinary
means, and the commission went there as a kind<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
of supreme authority, accepting or rejecting claims and
paying them as we thought fit after examining the evidence.</p>

<p>Sixteen hundred and ninety-six claims, amounting
to $599,219.36, were examined by us. Of those approved
and certified for payment the amount was $451,105.80.
Of the claims rejected, a considerable portion
were for losses suffered in the active operations of the
army, either through departure from discipline on the
part of soldiers, or from requisitions made by officers
who failed to give receipts and certificates to the persons
concerned, who were thus unable to support their
claims by sufficient evidence. Many claims of this description
were also presented by men whose loyalty
to the Government was impeached by credible witnesses.
In rejecting these the commission set forth the
disloyalty of the claimants, in the certificates written
on the face of their accounts. Other accounts, whose
rightfulness was established, were rejected on proof of
disloyalty. The commission regarded complicity in the
rebellion as barring all claims against the United States.</p>

<p>A question of some interest was raised by the claim
of the trustees of the Cairo city property to be paid for
the use by the Government wharf boats of the paved
portion of the levee which protected the town against
the Ohio River. We were unable to see the matter in
the light presented by the trustees. Our judgment was
that the Government ought not to pay for the use of
necessary landing places on these rivers or elsewhere
during the exigencies of the war, and we so certified
upon the face of the claims. A similar principle guided<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
our decision upon several claims for the rent of vacant
lots in Cairo, which had been used by the military authorities
for the erection of temporary barracks or
stables. We determined that for these no rent ought,
under the circumstances, to be allowed, but we suggested
that in justice to the owners this temporary occupation
should be terminated as soon as possible by
the sale and removal of the buildings.</p>

<p>A very small percentage of the claims were rejected
because of fraud. In almost every case it was possible
to suppose that the apparent fraud was accident. My observation
throughout the war was the same. I do not
believe that so much business could be transacted with a
closer adherence to the line of honesty. That there were
frauds is a matter of course, because men, and even
some women, are wicked, but frauds were the exception.</p>

<p>Our commission finished its labors at Cairo on July
31, 1862, and I went at once to Washington with the
report, placing it in the hands of Mr. Stanton on August
5th. It was never printed, and the manuscript is still
in the files of the War Department.</p>

<p>There was a great deal of curiosity among officers in
Washington about the result of our investigation, and
all the time that I was in the city I was being questioned
on the subject. It was natural enough that they
should have felt interested in our report. The charges
of fraud and corruption against officers and contractors
had become so reckless and general that the mere sight
of a man in conference with a high official led to the
suspicion and often the charge that he was conspiring
to rob the Government. That in this case, where the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
charges seemed so well based, so small a percentage of
corruption had been proved was a source of solid satisfaction
to every one in the War Department.</p>

<p class='p2'>All the leisure that I had while in Cairo I spent in
horseback riding up and down the river banks and in
visiting the adjacent military posts. My longest and
most interesting trip was on the Fourth of July, when I
went down the Mississippi to attend a big celebration
at Memphis. I remember it particularly because it was
there that I first met General Grant. The officers stationed
in the city gave a dinner that day, to which I was
invited. At the table I was seated between Grant and
Major John A. Rawlins, of his staff. I remember distinctly
the pleasant impression Grant made&mdash;that of a
man of simple manners, straightforward, cordial, and
unpretending. He had already fought the successful
battles of Fort Donelson and Shiloh, and, when I met
him, was a major general in command of the district of
West Tennessee, Department of the Missouri, under
Halleck, with headquarters at Memphis. Although
one would not have suspected it from his manners, he
was really under a cloud at the time because of his
operations at Shiloh. Those who did not like Grant
had accused him of having been taken by surprise there,
and had declared that he would have been beaten if
Buell had not come up. I often talked later with
Grant's staff officers about Shiloh, and they always
affirmed that he would have been successful if Buell had
not come to his relief. I believe Grant himself thought
so, although he never said so directly in any one of the
many talks I had with him about the battle.</p>

<p>As Mr. Stanton had no immediate need of my services,
I returned in August to New York, where I was
occupied with various private affairs until the middle
of November, when I received a telegram from Assistant-Secretary-of-War
P. H. Watson, asking me to go
immediately to Washington to enter upon another investigation.
I went, and was received by Mr. Stanton,
who offered me the place of Assistant Secretary of War.
I said I would accept.</p>

<p>"All right," said he; "consider it settled."</p>

<p>As I went out from the War Department into the
street I met Major Charles G. Halpine&mdash;"Miles
O'Reilly"&mdash;of the Sixty-ninth New York Infantry. I
had known Halpine well as a newspaper man in New
York, and I told him of my appointment as Mr. Stanton's
assistant. He immediately repeated what I had
told him to some newspaper people. It was reported in
the New York papers the next morning. The Secretary
was greatly offended and withdrew the appoint<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>ment.
When I told Halpine I had, of course, no idea
he was going to repeat it; besides, I did not think there
was any harm in telling.</p>

<p>Immediately after this episode I formed a partnership
with Roscoe Conkling and George W. Chadwick to
buy cotton. The outcry which the manufacturers had
raised over the inability to get cotton for their industries
had induced the Government to permit trading
through the lines of the army, and the business looked
profitable. Conkling and I each put ten thousand dollars
into the firm, and Chadwick gave his services, which,
as he was an expert in cotton, was considered equal to
our capital. To facilitate our operations, I went to
Washington to ask Mr. Stanton for letters of recommendation
to the generals on and near the Mississippi,
where we proposed to begin our purchases. Mr. Stanton
and I had several conversations about the advisability
of allowing such traffic, but he did not hesitate about
giving me the letters I asked. There were several of
them: one to General Hurlbut, then at Memphis; another
to General Grant, who had begun his movement
against Vicksburg; and another to General Curtis, who
commanded in Arkansas. The general purport of them
was: "Mr. Dana is my friend; you can rely upon what
he says, and if you can be kind to him in any way you
will oblige me."</p>

<p>It was in January, 1863, that Chadwick and I went
to Memphis, where we stayed at the Gayoso House, at
that time the swell hotel of the town and the headquarters
of several officers.</p>

<p>It was not long after I began to study the trade<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
in cotton before I saw it was a bad business and ought
to be stopped. I at once wrote Mr. Stanton the following
letter, which embodied my observations and gave
my opinion as to what should be done:</p>

<div class='letter'>

<p class='nr5right'>
<span class="smcap">Memphis</span>, <i class='date'>January 21, 1863</i>.
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>: You will remember our conversations on
the subject of excluding cotton speculators from the
regions occupied by our armies in the South. I now
write to urge the matter upon your attention as a measure
of military necessity.</p>

<p>The mania for sudden fortunes made in cotton, raging
in a vast population of Jews and Yankees scattered
throughout this whole country, and in this town almost
exceeding the numbers of the regular residents, has to
an alarming extent corrupted and demoralized the army.
Every colonel, captain, or quartermaster is in secret
partnership with some operator in cotton; every soldier
dreams of adding a bale of cotton to his monthly pay.
I had no conception of the extent of this evil until I
came and saw for myself.</p>

<p>Besides, the resources of the rebels are inordinately
increased from this source. Plenty of cotton is brought
in from beyond our lines, especially by the agency of
Jewish traders, who pay for it ostensibly in Treasury
notes, but really in gold.</p>

<p>What I would propose is that no private purchaser
of cotton shall be allowed in any part of the occupied
region.</p>

<p>Let quartermasters buy the article at a fixed price,
say twenty or twenty-five cents per pound, and forward
it by army transportation to proper centers, say Helena,
Memphis, or Cincinnati, to be sold at public auction on
Government account. Let the sales take place on
regular fixed days, so that all parties desirous of buying
can be sure when to be present.</p>

<p>But little capital will be required for such an operation.
The sales being frequent and for cash, will con<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>stantly
replace the amount employed for the purpose.
I should say that two hundred thousand dollars would
be sufficient to conduct the movement.</p>

<p>I have no doubt that this two hundred thousand
dollars so employed would be more than equal to thirty
thousand men added to the national armies.</p>

<p>My pecuniary interest is in the continuance of the
present state of things, for while it lasts there are occasional
opportunities of profit to be made by a daring
operator; but I should be false to my duty did I, on that
account, fail to implore you to put an end to an evil so
enormous, so insidious, and so full of peril to the
country.</p>

<p>My first impulse was to hurry to Washington to
represent these things to you in person; but my engagements
here with other persons will not allow me
to return East so speedily. I beg you, however, to act
without delay, if possible. An excellent man to put at
the head of the business would be General Strong. I
make this suggestion without any idea whether the employment
would be agreeable to him.</p>

<p class='nr5right'>
Yours faithfully,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  <span class="smcap">Charles A. Dana</span>.</p>
<p class='nr3left'>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Stanton</span>.
</p>

<p>P.S.&mdash;Since writing the above I have seen General
Grant, who fully agrees with all my statements and suggestions,
except that imputing corruption to every
officer, which of course I did not intend to be taken
literally.</p>

<p>I have also just attended a public sale by the quartermaster
here of five hundred bales of cotton confiscated
by General Grant at Oxford and Holly Springs.
It belonged to Jacob Thompson and other notorious
rebels. This cotton brought to-day over a million and
a half of dollars, cash. This sum alone would be five
times enough to set on foot the system I recommend,
without drawing upon the Treasury at all. In fact,
there can be no question that by adopting this system
the quartermaster's department in this valley <em>would be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>come
self-supporting</em>, while the army would become
honest again, and the slaveholders would no longer
find that the rebellion had quadrupled the price of their
great staple, but only doubled it.</p></div>

<p>As soon as I could get away from Memphis I went
to Washington, where I had many conversations with
Mr. Lincoln and Mr. Stanton about restricting the
trade in cotton. They were deeply interested in my
observations, and questioned me closely about what I
had seen. My opinion that the trade should be stopped
had the more weight because I was able to say, "General
Grant and every general officer whom I have seen
hopes it will be done."</p>

<p>The result of these consultations was that on March
31, 1863, Mr. Lincoln issued a proclamation declaring
unlawful all commercial intercourse with the States in
insurrection, except when carried on according to the
regulations prescribed by the Secretary of the Treasury.
These regulations Mr. Chase prepared at once. At the
same time that Mr. Lincoln issued his proclamation,
Mr. Stanton issued an order forbidding officers and all
members of the army to have anything to do with the
trade. In spite of all these regulations, however, and
the modifications of them which experience brought,
there was throughout the war more or less difficulty
over cotton trading.</p>

<p>From Washington I went back to New York. I
had not been there long before Mr. Stanton sent for me
to come to Washington. He wanted some one to go to
Grant's army, he said, to report daily to him the military
proceedings, and to give such information as would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
enable Mr. Lincoln and himself to settle their minds as
to Grant, about whom at that time there were many
doubts, and against whom there was some complaint.</p>

<p>"Will you go?" Mr. Stanton asked. "Yes," I said.
"Very well," he replied. "The ostensible function I
shall give you will be that of special commissioner of
the War Department to investigate the pay service of
the Western armies, but your real duty will be to report
to me every day what you see."</p>

<p>On March 12th Mr. Stanton wrote me the following
letter:</p>

<div class='letter'>

<p class='nr9right'>

with a letter to Generals Sumner,<a name="FNanchor_B_2" id="FNanchor_B_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_B_2" class="fnanchor">[B]</a> Grant, and Rosecrans,
and a draft for one thousand dollars. Having
explained the purposes of your appointment to you personally,
no further instructions will be given unless
specially required. Please acknowledge the receipt of
this, and proceed as early as possible to your duties.</p>

<p class='nr5right'>
Yours truly,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span class="smcap">Edwin M. Stanton</span>.</p>

<p>My commission read:</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ordered</span>, That C. A. Dana, Esq., be and he is
hereby appointed special commissioner of the War Department

any matters concerning which he may make inquiry<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
of them as fully and completely and promptly as if directly

him transportation and subsistence. All officers and

<p>The letters of introduction and explanation to the
generals were identical:</p>

<p class='nr5right'>
<span class="smcap">Edwin M. Stanton</span>.
</p></div>

<p>I started at once for Memphis, going by way of
Cairo and Columbus.</p>

<p>I sent my first dispatch to the War Department
from Columbus, on March 20th. It was sent by a secret
cipher furnished by the War Department, which I used
myself, for throughout the war I was my own cipher
clerk. The ordinary method at the various headquarters
was for the sender to write out the dispatch in full,
after which it was translated from plain English into the
agreed cipher by a telegraph operator or clerk retained
for that exclusive purpose, who understood it, and by
another it was retranslated back again at the other end<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
of the line. So whatever military secret was transmitted
was at the mercy always of at least two outside
persons, besides running the gantlet of other prying
eyes. Dispatches written in complex cipher codes were
often difficult to unravel, unless transmitted by the
operator with the greatest precision. A wrong word
sometimes destroyed the sense of an entire dispatch,
and important movements were delayed thereby. This
explains the oft-repeated "I do not understand your
telegram" found in the official correspondence of the
war period.</p>

<p>I have become familiar since the war with a great
many ciphers, but I never found one which was more
satisfactory than that which I used in my messages to
Mr. Stanton. In preparing my message I first wrote it
out in lines of a given number of words, spaced regularly
so as to form five, six, seven, eight, nine, and ten
columns. My key contained various "routes," to be
followed in writing out the messages for transmission.
Thus, a five-column message had one route, a six-column
another, and so on. The route was indicated by
a "commencement word." If I had put my message
into five columns, I would write at the beginning the
word "Army," or any one in a list of nine words. The
receiver, on looking for that word in his key, would
see that he was to write out what he had received in
lines of five words, thus forming five columns; and then
he was to read it down the fifth column, up the third,
down the fourth, up the second, down the first. At the
end of each column an "extra" or "check" word was
added as a blind. A list of "blind" words was also<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
printed in the key, with each route, which could be inserted,
if wished, at the end of each line so as still further
to deceive curious people who did not have the key.
The key contained also a large number of cipher words.
Thus, P. H. Sheridan was "soap" or "Somerset";
President was "Pembroke" or "Penfield." Instead of
writing "there has been," I wrote "maroon"; instead
of secession, "mint"; instead of Vicksburg, "Cupid."
My own cipher was "spunky" or "squad." The days,
months, hours, numerals, and alphabet all had ciphers.</p>

<p>The only message sent by this cipher to be translated
by an outsider on the route, so far as I know, was
that one of 4 <small>P.M.</small>, September 20, 1863, in which I reported
the Union defeat at Chickamauga. General R.
S. Granger, who was then at Nashville, was at the telegraph
office waiting for news when my dispatch passed
through. The operator guessed out the dispatch, as he
afterward confessed, and it was passed around Nashville.
The agent of the Associated Press at Louisville
sent out a private printed circular quoting me as an
authority for reporting the battle as a total defeat, and
in Cincinnati Horace Maynard repeated, the same day
of the battle, the entire second sentence of the dispatch,
"Chickamauga is as fatal a name in our history as Bull
Run."</p>

<p>This premature disclosure to the public of what was
only the truth, well known at the front, caused a great
deal of trouble. I immediately set on foot an investigation
to discover who had penetrated our cipher code,
and soon arrived at a satisfactory understanding of the
matter, of which Mr. Stanton was duly informed. No<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
blame could attach to me, as was manifest upon the inquiry;
nevertheless, the sensation resulted in considerable
annoyance all along the line from Chattanooga
to Washington. I suggested to Mr. Stanton the advisability
of concocting a new and more difficult cipher,
but it was never changed, so far as I now remember.</p>

<p>It was from Columbus, Ky., on March 20, 1863,
that I sent my first telegram to the War Department.
I did not remain in Columbus long, for there was absolutely
no trustworthy information there respecting affairs
down the river, but took a boat to Memphis,
where I arrived on March 23d. I found General Hurlbut
in command. I had met Hurlbut in January, when
on my cotton business, and he gave me every opportunity
to gather information concerning the operations
against Vicksburg. Four different plans for reaching
the city were then on foot, the essential element of all
of them being to secure for the army on the high
ground behind the city a foothold whence it could
strike, and at the same time be supplied from a river
base. The first and oldest and apparently most promising
of these plans was that of the canal across the
neck of the peninsula facing Vicksburg, on the Louisiana
side. When I reached Memphis this canal was
thought to be nearly done.</p>

<p>The second route was by Lake Providence, about
forty miles north of Vicksburg, in Louisiana. It was
close to the western bank of the Mississippi, with which
it was proposed to connect it by means of a canal. The
Bayou Macon connected Lake Providence with the
Tensas River. By descending the Tensas to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
Washita, the Washita to the Red, the Red to the Mississippi,
the army could be landed on the east bank of
the Mississippi about one hundred and fifty miles south
of Vicksburg, and thence could be marched north. McPherson,
with his Seventeenth Corps, had been ordered
by Grant on January 30th to open this route. It was
reported at Memphis when I arrived there that the
cutting of Lake Providence was perfectly successful,
but that Bayou Macon was full of snags, which must be
got out before the Tensas would be accessible.</p>

<p>The third and fourth routes proposed for getting
behind Vicksburg&mdash;namely, by Yazoo Pass and Steele's
Bayou&mdash;were attracting the chief attention when I
reached Memphis. Yazoo Pass opened from the eastern
bank of the Mississippi at a point about one hundred
and fifty miles above Vicksburg into Moon Lake,
and thence into the Coldwater River. Through the
Coldwater and the Tallahatchie the Yazoo River was
reached. If troops could follow this route and capture
Haynes's Bluff, fourteen miles from the mouth of the
Yazoo, Vicksburg at once became untenable. The
Yazoo Pass operation had begun in February, but the
detachment had had bad luck, and on my arrival at
Memphis was lying up the Yallabusha waiting for re-enforcements
and supplies.</p>

<p>An attempt was being made also to reach the Yazoo
by a roundabout route through Steele's Bayou, Deer
Creek, the Rolling Fork, and the Big Sunflower. Grant
had learned of this route only a short time before my
arrival, and had at once sent Sherman with troops and
Admiral Porter with gunboats to attempt to reach the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
Yazoo. On March 27th reports came to Memphis that
Sherman had landed twenty regiments on the east bank
of the Yazoo above Haynes's Bluff, and that the gunboats
were there to support him. Reports from other
points also were so encouraging that the greatest enthusiasm
prevailed throughout the army, and General
Grant was said to be dead sure he would have Vicksburg
within a fortnight.</p>

<p>Five days later, however, we heard at Memphis that
there had been a series of disasters in these different
operations, that the Yazoo Pass expedition was definitely
abandoned, and that General Grant had an entirely
new plan of campaign.</p>

<p>I had not been long at Memphis before I decided
that it was impossible to gather trustworthy news there.
I had to rely for most of my information on the reports
brought up the river by occasional officers, not all
of whom were sure of what they told, and on the stories
of persons coming from the vicinity of the different
operations. Occasionally an intelligent planter arrived
whom I was inclined to believe, but on the whole I
found that my sources of information were few and uncertain.
I accordingly suggested to Mr. Stanton, three
days after my arrival, that I would be more useful farther
down the river. In reply he telegraphed:</p>

<div class='letter'>

<p class='nr9right'>
<span class="smcap">War Department,</span></p>
<p class='nr5right'><span class="smcap">Washington City</span>, <i class='date'>March 30, 1863</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">C. A. Dana</span>, Esq., Memphis, Tenn., via Cairo:
</p>

<p>Your telegrams have been received, and although
the information has been meager and unsatisfactory, I
am conscious that arises from no fault of yours. You
will proceed to General Grant's headquarters, or wher<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>ever
you may be best able to accomplish the purposes
designated by this department. You will consider your

without any restriction.</p>

<p class='nr9right'>
<span class="smcap">Edwin M. Stanton</span>,</p>
<p class='nr5right'><i class='title'>Secretary of War</i>.
</p></div>

<p>As soon after receiving his telegram as I could get a
boat I left Memphis for Milliken's Bend, where General
Grant had his headquarters. I reached there at noon on
April 6th.</p>

<p>The Mississippi at Milliken's Bend was a mile wide,
and the sight as we came down the river by boat was
most imposing. Grant's big army was stretched up and
down the river bank over the plantations, its white tents
affording a new decoration to the natural magnificence
of the broad plains. These plains, which stretch far
back from the river, were divided into rich and old plantations
by blooming hedges of rose and Osage orange,
the mansions of the owners being inclosed in roses,
myrtles, magnolias, oaks, and every other sort of beautiful
and noble trees. The negroes whose work made
all this wealth and magnificence were gone, and there
was nothing growing in the fields.</p>

<p>For some days after my arrival I lived in a steamboat
tied up to the shore, for though my tent was
pitched and ready, I was not able to get a mattress and
pillow. From the deck of the steamer I saw in those
days many a wonderful and to me novel sight. One
I remember still. I was standing out on the upper
deck with a group of officers, when we saw far away,
close to the other shore of the river, a long line of some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>thing
white floating in the water. We thought it was
foam, but it was too long and white, and that it was
cotton which had been thrown into the river, but it was
too straight and regular. Presently we heard a gun
fired, then another, and then we saw it was an enormous
flock of swans. They arose from the water one
after the other, and sailed away up the river in long,
curving, silver lines, bending and floating almost like
clouds, and finally disappearing high up in the air above
the green woods on the Mississippi shore. I suppose
there were a thousand of them.</p>

<p>I had not been long at Milliken's Bend before I
was on friendly terms with all the generals, big and
little, and one or two of them I found were very rare
men. Sherman especially impressed me as a man of
genius and of the widest intellectual acquisitions.
Every day I rode in one direction or another with an
officer, inspecting the operations going on. From what
I saw on my rides over the country I got a new insight
into slavery, which made me no more a friend to that
institution than I was before. I had seen slavery in
Maryland, Kentucky, Virginia, and Missouri, but it was
not till I saw these great Louisiana plantations with all
their apparatus for living and working that I really felt
the aristocratic nature of the institution, and the infernal
baseness of that aristocracy. Every day my conviction
was intensified that the territorial and political
integrity of the nation must be preserved at all costs,
no matter how long it took; that it was better to keep
up the existing war as long as was necessary, rather
than to make arrangement for indefinite wars hereafter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
and for other disruptions; that we must have it out then,
and settle forever the question, so that our children
would be able to attend to other matters. For my own
part, I preferred one nation and one country, with a
military government afterward, if such should follow,
rather than two or three nations and countries with
the semblance of the old Constitution in each of them,
ending in wars and despotisms everywhere.</p>

<p>As soon as I arrived at Milliken's Bend, on April
6th, I had hunted up Grant and explained my mission.
He received me cordially. Indeed, I think Grant was
always glad to have me with his army. He did not like
letter writing, and my daily dispatches to Mr. Stanton
relieved him from the necessity of describing every day
what was going on in the army. From the first neither
he nor any of his staff or corps commanders evinced
any unwillingness to show me the inside of things. In
this first interview at Milliken's Bend, for instance,
Grant explained to me so fully his new plan of campaign&mdash;for
there was now but one&mdash;that by three
o'clock I was able to send an outline of it to Mr. Stanton.
From that time I saw and knew all the interior
operations of that toughest of tough jobs, the reopening
of the Mississippi.</p>

<p>The new project, so Grant told me, was to transfer
his army to New Carthage, and from there carry it over
the Mississippi, landing it at or about Grand Gulf; to
capture this point, and then to operate rapidly on the
southern and eastern shore of the Big Black River,
threatening at the same time both Vicksburg and Jackson,
and confusing the Confederates as to his real ob<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>jective.
If this could be done he believed the enemy
would come out of Vicksburg and fight.</p>

<p>The first element in this plan was to open a passage
from the Mississippi near Milliken's Bend, above Vicksburg,
to the bayou on the west side, which led around
to New Carthage below. The length of navigation in
this cut-off was about thirty-seven miles, and the plan
was to take through with small tugs perhaps fifty barges,
enough, at least, to transfer the whole army, with artillery
and baggage, to the other side of the Mississippi in
twenty-four hours. If necessary, troops were to be
transported by the canal, though Grant hoped to march
them by the road along its bank. Part of McClernand's
corps had already reached New Carthage overland,
and Grant was hurrying other troops forward. The
canal to the bayou was already half completed,
thirty-five hundred men being at work on it when I
arrived.</p>

<p>The second part of the plan was to float down the
river, past the Vicksburg batteries, half a dozen steamboats
protected by defenses of bales of cotton and wet
hay; these steamboats were to serve as transports of
supplies after the army had crossed the Mississippi.</p>

<p>Perhaps the best evidence of the feasibility of the
project was found in the fact that the river men pronounced
its success certain. General Sherman, who
commanded one of the three corps in Grant's army, and
with whom I conversed at length upon the subject,
thought there was no difficulty in opening the passage,
but that the line would be a precarious one for supplies
after the army was thrown across the Mississippi. Sher<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>man's
preference was for a movement by way of Yazoo
Pass, or Lake Providence, but it was not long before I
saw in our daily talks that his mind was tending to the
conclusion of General Grant. As for General Grant, his
purpose was dead set on the new scheme. Admiral
Porter cordially agreed with him.</p>

<p>An important modification was made a few days
after my arrival in the plan of operations. It was determined
that after the occupation of Grand Gulf the main
army, instead of operating up the Big Black toward
Jackson, should proceed down the river against Port
Hudson, co-operating with General Banks against
that point, and that after the capture of Port Hudson
the two united forces should proceed against
Vicksburg.</p>

<p>There seemed to be only one hitch in the campaign.
Grant had intrusted the attack on Grand Gulf to McClernand.
Sherman, Porter, and other leading officers
believed this a mistake, and talked frankly with me
about it. One night when we had all gathered at
Grant's headquarters and were talking over the campaign
very freely, as we were accustomed to do, both
Sherman and Porter protested against the arrangement.
But Grant would not be changed. McClernand, he
said, was exceedingly desirous of the command. He
was the senior of the other corps commanders. He was
an especial favorite of the President, and the position
which his corps occupied on the ground when the movement
was first projected was such that the advance
naturally fell to its lot; besides, he had entered zealously
into the plan from the first, while Sherman had doubted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
and criticised, and McPherson, whom Grant said he
would really have much preferred, was away at Lake
Providence, and though he had approved of the scheme,
he had taken no active part in it.</p>

<p>I believed the assignment of this duty to McClernand
to be so dangerous that I added my expostulation to
those of the generals, and in reporting the case to Mr.
Stanton I wrote: "I have remonstrated so far as I could
properly do so against intrusting so momentous an
operation to McClernand."</p>

<p>Mr. Stanton replied: "Allow me to suggest that
you carefully avoid giving any advice in respect to commands
that may be assigned, as it may lead to misunderstanding
and troublesome complications." Of
course, after that I scrupulously observed his directions,
even in extreme cases.</p>

<p>As the days went on everybody, in spite of this hitch,
became more sanguine that the new project would succeed.
For my part I had not a doubt of it, as one can
see from this fragment written from Milliken's Bend on
April 13th to one of my friends:</p>

<p class='p2'>"Like all who really know the facts, I feel no sort
of doubt that we shall before long get the nut cracked.
Probably before this letter reaches New York on its
way to you the telegraph will get ahead of it with the
news that Grant, masking Vicksburg, deemed impregnable
by its defenders, has carried the bulk of his army
down the river through a cut-off which he has opened
without the enemy believing it could be done; has occupied
Grand Gulf, taken Port Hudson, and, effecting a
junction with the forces of Banks, has returned up the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
river to threaten Jackson and compel the enemy to come
out of Vicksburg and fight him on ground of his own
choosing. Of course this scheme may miscarry in whole
or in parts, but as yet the chances all favor its execution,
which is now just ready to begin."</p>

Confederate batteries&mdash;Headquarters moved to Smith's plantation&mdash;Delay
and confusion in McClernand's command&mdash;The unsuccessful
attack on Grand Gulf&mdash;The move to the east shore&mdash;Mr.

<p>On the new lines adopted by General Grant, the
work went on cheeringly, though every day changes
were made in the details. I spent my days in riding from
point to point, noting the progress. I went out often
with Colonel G. G. Pride, the engineer officer, in whose
mess I was, and who was superintending the construction
of the canal which led from Duckport to the bayou.
The work on this canal was a curious sight to see, for
there was a force equal to five regiments at the digging,
while a large number of pioneers were engaged in clearing
the bayou beyond. The canal was opened on April
13th, and the authorities agreed that there was no reason
to doubt its usefulness, though the obstructions in
the bayou were so numerous that it was thought that it
would require several days more to clear a passage for
tugs and barges.</p>

<p>One of my most interesting trips from Milliken's
Bend was made with Major James H. Wilson to view
the casemated batteries our engineers were constructing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
on the shore opposite Vicksburg. They hoped with the
thirty-pound Parrotts they were putting in to be able
to destroy any building in the town. From behind the
levee of the peninsula we were able with our glasses to
examine the fortifications of Vicksburg.</p>

<p>The best look I had at that town, however, while
I was at Milliken's Bend was not from the peninsula
opposite, but from a gunboat. On April 12th I went
down with a flag of truce to the vicinity of Vicksburg,
so that I got a capital view. It was an ugly place,
with its line of bluffs commanding the channel for fully
seven miles, and battery piled above battery all the
way.</p>

<p>Admiral Porter's arrangements for carrying out the
second part of Grant's scheme&mdash;that is, running the
Vicksburg batteries&mdash;were all completed by April 16th,
the ironclads and steamers being protected in vulnerable
parts by bulwarks of hay, cotton, and sand bags, and
the barges loaded with forage, coal, and the camp equipment
of General McClernand's corps, which was already
at New Carthage. No doubt was felt that the design
was known in Vicksburg, and it was arranged that Admiral
Porter should open fire there with all his guns as
he swept past the town, and that the new batteries on
the levee opposite the city should also participate.
Admiral Porter was to go with the expedition on a small
tug, and he invited me to accompany him, but it seemed
to me that I ought not to get out of my communications,
and so refused. Instead, I joined Grant on his
headquarters boat, which was stationed on the right
bank of the river, where from the bows we could see the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
squadron as it started, and could follow its course until
it was nearly past Vicksburg.</p>

<p>Just before ten o'clock on the night of April 16th
the squadron cast loose its moorings. It was a strange
scene. First a mass of black things detached itself from
the shore, and we saw it float out toward the middle
of the stream. There was nothing to be seen except
this big black mass, which dropped slowly down the
river. Soon another black mass detached itself, and another,
then another. It was Admiral Porter's fleet of
ironclad turtles, steamboats, and barges. They floated
down the Mississippi darkly and silently, showing
neither steam nor light, save occasionally a signal astern,
where the enemy could not see it.</p>

<p>The vessels moved at intervals of about two hundred
yards. First came seven ironclad turtles and one heavy
armed ram; following these were two side-wheel
steamers and one stern-wheel, having twelve barges in
tow; these barges carried the supplies. Far astern of
them was one carrying ammunition. The most of the
gunboats had already doubled the tongue of land which
stretches northeasterly in front of Vicksburg, and they
were immediately under the guns of nearly all the Confederate
batteries, when there was a flash from the upper
forts, and then for an hour and a half the cannonade was
terrific, raging incessantly along the line of about four
miles in extent. I counted five hundred and twenty-five
discharges. Early in the action the enemy put the
torch to a frame building in front of Vicksburg to light
up the scene and direct his fire.</p>

<p>About 12.45 <small>A.M.</small> one our steamers, the Henry<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
Clay, took fire, and burned for three quarters of an
hour. The Henry Clay was lost by being abandoned
by her captain and crew in a panic, they thinking her to
be sinking. The pilot refused to go with them, and
said if they would stay they would get her through safe.
After they had fled in the yawls, the cotton bales on her
deck took fire, and one wheel became unmanageable.
The pilot then ran her aground, and got upon a plank,
on which he was picked up four miles below.</p>

<p>The morning after Admiral Porter had run the
Vicksburg batteries I went with General Grant to New
Carthage to review the situation. We found the squadron
there, all in fighting condition, though most of them
had been hit. Not a man had been lost.</p>

<p>As soon as we returned to Milliken's Bend Grant
ordered that six transport steamers, each loaded with
one hundred thousand rations and forty days' coal,
should be made ready to run the Vicksburg batteries.
The order was executed on the night of the 22d. The
transports were manned throughout, officers, engineers,
pilots, and deck hands, by volunteers from the army,
mainly from Logan's division. This dangerous service
was sought with great eagerness, and experienced men
had been found for every post. If ten thousand men had
been wanted instead of one hundred and fifty, they
would have engaged with zeal in the adventure. In
addition to bulwarks of hay, cotton, and pork barrels,
each transport was protected by a barge on each side
of it. Orders were to drop noiselessly down with the
current from the mouth of the Yazoo, and not show
steam till the enemy's batteries began firing, when the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
boats were to use all their legs. The night was cloudy,
and the run was made with the loss of one of the transports,
the Tigress, which was sunk, and a few men
wounded.</p>

<p>The day after these transports with supplies ran the
Vicksburg batteries General Grant changed his headquarters
to Smith's plantation, near New Carthage.
All of McClernand's corps, the Thirteenth, was now
near there, and that officer said ten thousand men would
be ready to move from New Carthage the next day.
McPherson's corps, which had been busy upon the Lake
Providence expedition and other services, but which
had been ordered to join, was now, except one division,
moving over from Milliken's Bend. Sherman's corps,
the Fifteenth, which had been stationed at Young's
Point, was also under marching orders to New Carthage.</p>

<p>Grant's first object now was to cross the Mississippi
as speedily as possible and capture Grand Gulf before it
could be re-enforced; but first it was necessary to know
the strength of this point. On the 22d Admiral Porter
had gone down with his gunboats and opened fire to
ascertain the position and strength of the batteries. He
reported them too strong to overcome, and earnestly
advised against a direct attack. He suggested that the
troops either be marched down the west side from New
Carthage to a point where they could be ferried over the
Mississippi just below Grand Gulf, or that they be embarked
on the transports and barges and floated past
the batteries in the night.</p>

<p>The day after Grant changed his headquarters to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
Smith's plantation he went himself with General Porter
to reconnoiter Grand Gulf. His reconnoissance convinced
him that the place was not so strong as Admiral
Porter had supposed, and an attack was ordered to be
made as soon as the troops could be made ready, the
next day, April 26th, if possible.</p>

<p>An irritating delay occurred then, however. McClernand's
corps was not ready to move. When we
came to Smith's plantation, on the 24th, I had seen
that there was apparently much confusion in McClernand's
command, and I was astonished to find, now
that he was ordered to move across the Mississippi, that
he was planning to carry his bride with her servants,
and baggage along with him, although Grant had
ordered that officers should leave behind everything
that could impede the march.</p>

<p>On the 26th, the day when it was hoped to make
an attack on Grand Gulf, I went with Grant by water
from our headquarters at Smith's plantation down
to New Carthage and to Perkins's plantation below,
where two of McClernand's divisions were encamped.
These troops, it was supposed, were ready for immediate
embarkation, and there were quite as many as all the
transports could carry, but the first thing which struck
us both on approaching the points of embarkation was
that the steamboats and barges were scattered about
in the river and in the bayou as if there was no idea of
the imperative necessity of the promptest movement
possible.</p>

<p>We at once steamed to Admiral Porter's flagship,
which was lying just above Grand Gulf, and Grant sent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
for McClernand, ordering him to embark his men without
losing a moment. In spite of this order, that night
at dark, when a thunderstorm set in, not a single cannon
or man had been moved. Instead, McClernand held a
review of a brigade of Illinois troops at Perkins's about
four o'clock in the afternoon. At the same time a salute
of artillery was fired, notwithstanding the positive
orders that had repeatedly been given to use no ammunition
for any purpose except against the enemy.</p>

<p>When we got back from the river to headquarters,
on the night of the 26th, we found that McPherson had
arrived at Smith's plantation with the first division of his
corps, the rear being not very far behind. His whole
force would have been up the next day, but it was necessary
to arrest its movements until McClernand could
be got out of the way; this made McClernand's delay
the more annoying. General Lorenzo Thomas, who
was on the Mississippi at this time organizing negro
troops, told me that he believed now that McPherson
would actually have his men ready to embark before
McClernand.</p>

<p>Early the next morning, April 27th, I went with
Grant from Smith's plantation back to New Carthage.
As soon as we arrived the general wrote a very severe
letter to McClernand, but learning that at last the transport
steamers and barges had been concentrated for
use he did not send the rebuke. Grant spent the day
there completing the preparations for embarking, and
on the morning of the 28th about ten thousand men
were on board. This force was not deemed sufficient
for the attack on Grand Gulf, so the troops were brought<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
down to Hard Times landing, on the Louisiana side,
almost directly across the river from Grand Gulf, where
a portion of them were debarked, and the transports
sent back for Hovey's division, six thousand strong.
We spent the night at Hard Times waiting for these
troops, which arrived about daylight on the morning of
the 29th.</p>

<p>There were now sixteen thousand men at Hard
Times ready to be landed at the foot of the Grand Gulf
bluff as soon as its batteries were silenced. At precisely
eight o'clock the gunboats opened their attack. Seven,
all ironclads, were engaged, and a cannonade was
kept up for nearly six hours. We soon found that the
enemy had five batteries, the first and most formidable
of them being placed on the high promontory close to
the mouth of the Big Black. The lower batteries,
mounting smaller guns and having no more than two
pieces each, were silenced early in the action, but this
one obstinately resisted. For the last four hours of the
engagement the whole seven gunboats were employed
in firing at this one battery, now at long range, seeking
to drop shells within the parapet, now at the very foot
of the hill, within about two hundred yards, endeavoring
to dismount its guns by direct fire. It was hit again
and again, but its pieces were not disabled. At last,
about half past one o'clock, Admiral Porter gave the
signal to withdraw. The gunboats had been hit more
or less severely. I was on board the Benton during the
attack, and saw that her armor had been pierced repeatedly
both in her sides and her pilot house, but she
had not a gun disabled; and except for the holes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
through her mail, some of them in her hull, she was as
ready to fight as at the beginning of the action.</p>

<p>The batteries having proved too much for the gunboats,
General Grant determined to execute an alternative
plan which he had had in mind from the first; that
was, to debark the troops and march them south across
the peninsula which faces Grand Gulf to a place out of
reach of the Confederate guns. While the engagement
between the gunboats and batteries had been going on,
all the rest of McClernand's corps had reached Hard
Times, having marched around by land, and three divisions
of McPherson's corps had also come up. This
entire body of about thirty-five thousand men was immediately
started across the peninsula to De Shroon's
plantation, where it was proposed to embark them again.</p>

<p>Late in the evening I left Hard Times with Grant
to ride across the peninsula to De Shroon's. The night
was pitch dark, and, as we rode side by side, Grant's
horse suddenly gave a nasty stumble. I expected to see
the general go over the animal's head, and I watched
intently, not to see if he was hurt, but if he would show
any anger. I had been with Grant daily now for three
weeks, and I had never seen him ruffled or heard him
swear. His equanimity was becoming a curious spectacle
to me. When I saw his horse lunge my first
thought was, "Now he will swear." For an instant his
moral status was on trial; but Grant was a tenacious
horseman, and instead of going over the animal's head,
as I imagined he would, he kept his seat. Pulling up
his horse, he rode on, and, to my utter amazement, without
a word or sign of impatience. And it is a fact that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
though I was with Grant during the most trying campaigns
of the war, I never heard him use an oath.</p>

<p>In order to get the transports past Grand Gulf, Porter's
gunboats had engaged the batteries about dusk.
This artillery duel lasted until about ten o'clock, the
gunboats withdrawing as soon as the transports were
safely past, and steaming at once to De Shroon's plantation,
where General McClernand's corps was all ready
to take the transports. The night was spent in embarking
the men. By eleven o'clock the next morning,
April 30th, three divisions were landed on the east
shore of the Mississippi at the place General Grant had
selected. This was Bruinsburg, sixty miles south of
Vicksburg, and the first point south of Grand Gulf
from which the highlands of the interior could be
reached by a road over dry land.</p>

<p>I was obliged to separate from Grant on the 30th,
for the means for transporting troops and officers were
so limited that neither an extra man nor a particle of
unnecessary baggage was allowed, and I did not get
over until the morning of May 1st, after the army had
moved on Port Gibson, where they first engaged the
enemy. As soon as I was landed at Bruinsburg I
started in the direction of the battle, on foot, of course,
as no horses had been brought over. I had not gone
far before I overtook a quartermaster driving toward
Port Gibson; he took me into his wagon. About four
miles from Port Gibson we came upon the first signs of
the battle, a field where it was evident that there had
been a struggle. I got out of the wagon as we approached,
and started toward a little white house with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
green blinds, covered with vines. The little white house
had been taken as a field hospital, and the first thing my
eyes fell upon as I went into the yard was a heap of arms
and legs which had been amputated and thrown into
a pile outside. I had seen men shot and dead men
plenty, but this pile of legs and arms gave me a vivid
sense of war such as I had not before experienced.</p>

<p>As the army was pressing the Confederates toward
Port Gibson all that day I followed in the rear, without
overtaking General Grant. While trailing along after
the Union forces I came across Fred Grant, then a lad
of thirteen, who had been left asleep by his father on a
steamer at Bruinsburg, but who had started out on
foot like myself as soon as he awoke and found the
army had marched. We tramped and foraged together
until the next morning, when some officers who had
captured two old horses gave us each one. We got the
best bridles and saddles we could, and thus equipped
made our way into Port Gibson, which the enemy had
deserted and where General Grant now had his headquarters.
I rode that old horse for four or five days,
then by a chance I got a good one. A captured Confederate
officer had been brought before General Grant
for examination. Now this man had a very good horse,
and after Grant had finished his questions the officer
said:</p>

<p>"General, this horse and saddle are my private
property; they do not belong to the Confederate army;
they belong to me as a citizen, and I trust you will let
me have them. Of course, while I am a prisoner I do
not expect to be allowed to ride the horse, but I hope<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
you will regard him as my property, and finally restore
him to me."</p>

<p>"Well," said Grant, "I have got four or five first-rate
horses wandering somewhere about the Southern
Confederacy. They have been captured from me in
battle or by spies. I will authorize you, whenever you
find one of them, to take possession of him. I cheerfully
give him to you; but as for this horse, I think he is
just about the horse Mr. Dana needs."</p>

<p class='p2'>I rode my new acquisition afterward through that
whole campaign, and when I came away I turned him
over to the quartermaster. Whenever I went out with
General Grant anywhere he always had some question
to ask about that horse.</p>

<p>It was the second day of May, 1863, when I rode
into Port Gibson, Miss., and inquired for Grant's headquarters.
I found the general in a little house of
the village, busily directing the advance of the army.
He told me that in the battle of the day before the
Confederates had been driven back on the roads to
Grand Gulf and Vicksburg, and that our forces were
now in full pursuit. By the next morning, May 3d, our
troops had possession of the roads as far as the Big
Black. As soon as he was sure of this, General Grant
started with a brigade of infantry and some twenty cavalrymen
for Grand Gulf. I accompanied him on the
trip. When within about seven miles of Grand Gulf we
found that the town had been deserted, and leaving the
brigade we entered with the cavalry escort.</p>

<p>During this ride to Grand Gulf Grant made inquiries
on every side about the food supplies of the country we
were entering. He told me he had been gathering in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>formation
on this point ever since the army crossed the
Mississippi, and had made up his mind that both beef
and cattle and corn were abundant in the country. The
result of this inquiry was that here at Grand Gulf Grant
took the resolve which makes the Vicksburg campaign
so famous&mdash;that of abandoning entirely his base of supplies
as soon as the army was all up and the rations on
the way arrived, boldly striking into the interior, and
depending on the country for meat and even for bread.</p>

<p>We did not reach Grand Gulf until late on May 3d,
but at one o'clock on the morning of the 4th Grant was
off for the front. He had decided that it was useless to
bring up the army to this place, to the capture of which
we had been so long looking, and which had been
abandoned so quickly now that our army was across
the Mississippi. I did not follow until later in the day,
and so had an opportunity of seeing General Sherman.
His corps was marching from above as rapidly as possible
down to Hard Times landing, and he had come
over to Grand Gulf to see about debarking his troops
there; this he succeeded in doing a couple of days later.</p>

<p>That evening I joined Grant at his new headquarters
at Hankinson's Ferry on the Big Black, and now
began my first experience with army marching into an
enemy's territory. A glimpse of my life at this time is
given in a letter to a child, written the morning after I
rejoined Grant:</p>

<p>"All of a sudden it is very cold here. Two days ago
it was hot like summer, but now I sit in my tent in my
overcoat, writing, and thinking if I only were at home
instead of being almost two thousand miles away.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span></p>

<p>"Away yonder, in the edge of the woods, I hear
the drum-beat that calls the soldiers to their supper. It
is only a little after five o'clock, but they begin the day
very early and end it early. Pretty soon after dark they
are all asleep, lying in their blankets under the trees,
for in a quick march they leave their tents behind.
Their guns are all ready at their sides, so that if they
are suddenly called at night they can start in a moment.
It is strange in the morning before daylight to hear the
bugle and drums sound the reveille, which calls the army
to wake up. It will begin perhaps at a distance and
then run along the whole line, bugle after bugle and
drum after drum taking it up, and then it goes from
front to rear, farther and farther away, the sweet sounds
throbbing and rolling while you lie on the grass with
your saddle for a pillow, half awake, or opening your
eyes to see that the stars are all bright in the sky, or
that there is only a faint flush in the east, where the
day is soon to break.</p>

<p>"Living in camp is queer business. I get my meals
in General Grant's mess, and pay my share of the expenses.
The table is a chest with a double cover, which
unfolds on the right and the left; the dishes, knives and
forks, and caster are inside. Sometimes we get good
things, but generally we don't. The cook is an old
negro, black and grimy. The cooking is not as clean as
it might be, but in war you can't be particular about
such things.</p>

<p>"The plums and peaches here are pretty nearly ripe.
The strawberries have been ripe these few days, but the
soldiers eat them up before we get a sight of them. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
figs are as big as the end of your thumb, and the green
pears are big enough to eat. But you don't know what
beautiful flower gardens there are here. I never saw
such roses; and the other day I found a lily as big as a
tiger lily, only it was a magnificent red."</p>

<p>Grant's policy now was to push the Confederates
ahead of him up the Big Black River, threatening Jackson,
the State capital, and the Big Black bridge behind
Vicksburg, and capturing both if necessary. His
opinion was that this maneuver would draw Pemberton
out of Vicksburg and bring on a decisive battle
within ten days.</p>

<p>From Hankinson's Ferry, the headquarters were
changed on the 7th to Rocky Springs, and there we
remained until the 11th. By that time McClernand
and McPherson had advanced to within ten or twelve
miles of the railroad which runs from Vicksburg to
Jackson, and were lying nearly in an east and west line;
and Sherman's entire corps had reached Hankinson's
Ferry. Supplies which Grant had ordered from Milliken's
Bend had also arrived. The order was now given
to Sherman to destroy the bridge at Hankinson's Ferry,
the rear guards were abandoned, and our communications
cut. So complete was our isolation that it was ten
days after we left Rocky Springs, on May 11th, before I
was able to get another dispatch to Mr. Stanton.</p>

<p>This march toward Jackson proved to be no easy
affair. More than one night I bivouacked on the
ground in the rain after being all day in my saddle. The
most comfortable night I had, in fact, was in a church
of which the officers had taken possession. Having no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
pillow, I went up to the pulpit and borrowed the Bible
for the night. Dr. H. L. Hewitt, who was medical
director on Grant's staff, slept near me, and he always
charged me afterward with stealing that Bible.</p>

<p>In spite of the roughness of our life, it was all of intense
interest to me, particularly the condition of the
people over whose country we were marching. A fact
which impressed me was the total absence of men
capable of bearing arms. Only old men and children
remained. The young men were all in the army or
had perished in it. The South was drained of its youth.
An army of half a million with a white population of
only five millions to draw upon, must soon finish the
stock of raw material for soldiers. Another fact of
moment was that we found men who had at the first
sympathized with the rebellion, and even joined in it,
now of their own accord rendering Grant the most
valuable assistance, in order that the rebellion might
be ended as speedily as possible, and something saved
by the Southern people out of the otherwise total and
hopeless ruin. "Slavery is gone, other property is
mainly gone," they said, "but, for God's sake, let us save
some relic of our former means of living."</p>

<p>In this forward movement the left of the army was
ordered to hug the Big Black as closely as possible,
while the right moved straight on Raymond. On the
12th, the right wing, under McPherson, met the enemy
just west of Raymond. Grant at the time had his
headquarters about at the center of the army, with Sherman's
corps, some seven miles west of Raymond.
I left him to go to the scene of the battle at once. It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
was a hard-fought engagement, lasting some three
hours. McPherson drove the Confederates back to and
through Raymond, and there stopped. The next day
the advance of the army toward Jackson was continued.
It rained heavily on the march and the roads were very
heavy, but the troops were in the best of spirits at their
successes and prospects. This work was a great improvement
on digging canals and running batteries. On
the afternoon of the 14th, about two and a half miles
west of Jackson, McPherson and Sherman were temporarily
stopped by the enemy, but he was quickly defeated,
and that night we entered the capital of Mississippi.</p>

<p>At Jackson I received an important telegram from
Stanton, though how it got to me there I do not remember.
General Grant had been much troubled by
the delay McClernand had caused at New Carthage, but
he had felt reluctant to remove him as he had been
assigned to his command by the President. My reports
to the Secretary on the situation had convinced
him that Grant ought to have perfect independence in
the matter, so he telegraphed me as follows:</p>

<div class='letter'>

<p class='nr5right'>
<span class="smcap">Washington, D.C.</span>, <i class='date'>May 6, 1863</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">C. A. Dana</span>, Esq., Smith's Plantation, Ia.
</p>

<p>General Grant has full and absolute authority to
enforce his own commands and to remove any person
who by ignorance in action or any cause interferes
with or delays his operations. He has the full confidence
of the Government, is expected to enforce his
authority, and will be firmly and heartily supported,
but he will be responsible for any failure to exert his
powers. You may communicate this to him.</p>

<p class='nr5right'>
<span class="smcap">E. M. Stanton</span>, <i class='title'>Secretary of War</i>.
</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span></p>

<p>The very evening of the day that we reached Jackson,
Grant learned that Lieutenant-General Pemberton
had been ordered by General Joe Johnston to come
out of Vicksburg and attack our rear. Grant immediately
faced the bulk of his army about to meet the enemy,
leaving Sherman in Jackson to tear up the railroads
and destroy all the public property there that could be
of use to the Confederates. I remained with Sherman
to see the work of destruction. I remember now nothing
that I saw except the burning of vast quantities of
cotton packed in bales, and that I was greatly astonished
to see how slowly it burned.</p>

<p>On the afternoon of the 15th I joined Grant again
at his headquarters at Clinton. Early the next morning
we had definite information about Pemberton.
He was about ten miles to the west, with twenty-five
thousand men, as reported, and our advance was almost
up with him. We at once went forward to the front.
Here we found Pemberton in a most formidable position
on the crest of a wooded ridge called Champion's
Hill, over which the road passed longitudinally.
About eleven o'clock in the morning of the 16th
the battle began, and by four in the afternoon it was
won.</p>

<p>After the battle I started out on horseback with
Colonel Rawlins to visit the field. When we reached
Logan's command we found him greatly excited. He
declared the day was lost, and that he would soon be
swept from his position. I contested the point with
him. "Why, general," I said, "we have gained the
day."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span></p>

<p>He could not see it. "Don't you hear the cannon
over there?" he answered. "They will be down on us
right away! In an hour I will have twenty thousand
men to fight."</p>

<p>I found afterward that this was simply a curious
idiosyncrasy of Logan's. In the beginning of a fight he
was one of the bravest men that could be, saw no
danger, went right on fighting until the battle was over.
Then, after the battle was won, his mind gained an
immovable conviction that it was lost. Where we were
victorious, he thought that we were defeated. I had a
very interesting conversation with Logan on this day,
when he attempted to convince me that we had lost the
battle of Champion's Hill. It was merely an intellectual
peculiarity. It did not in the least impair his value as a
soldier or commanding officer. He never made any
mistake on account of it.</p>

<p>On leaving Logan, Rawlins and I were joined by
several officers, and we continued our ride over the
field. On the hill where the thickest of the fight had
taken place we stopped, and were looking around at
the dead and dying men lying all about us, when suddenly
a man, perhaps forty-five or fifty years old, who
had a Confederate uniform on, lifted himself up on his
elbow, and said:</p>

<p>"For God's sake, gentlemen, is there a Mason
among you?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Rawlins, "I am a Mason." He got
off his horse and kneeled by the dying man, who gave
him some letters out of his pocket. When he came
back Rawlins had tears on his cheeks. The man, he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
told us, wanted him to convey some souvenir&mdash;a miniature
or a ring, I do not remember what&mdash;to his wife,
who was in Alabama. Rawlins took the package, and
some time afterward he succeeded in sending it to the
woman.</p>

<p>I remained out late that night conversing with the
officers who had been in the battle, and think it must
have been about eleven o'clock when I got to Grant's
headquarters, where I was to sleep. Two or three
officers who had been out with me went with me into
the little cottage which Grant had taken possession of.
We found a wounded man there, a tall and fine-looking
man, a Confederate. He stood up suddenly and said:
"Kill me! Will some one kill me? I am in such anguish
that it will be mercy to do it&mdash;I have got to die&mdash;kill
me&mdash;don't let me suffer!" We sent for a surgeon,
who examined his case, but said it was hopeless. He
had been shot through the head, so that it had cut off
the optic nerve of both eyes. He never could possibly
see again. Before morning he died.</p>

<p>I was up at daylight the next day, and off with Grant
and his staff after the enemy. We rode directly west,
and overtook Pemberton at the Big Black. He had
made a stand on the bottom lands at the east head of the
Big Black bridge. Here he fought in rifle-pits, protected
by abatis and a difficult bayou. Lawler's brigade,
of McClernand's corps, charged the left of the Confederate
rifle-pits magnificently, taking more prisoners
than their own numbers. The others fled. Pemberton
burned his bridge and retreated rapidly into Vicksburg,
with only three cannon out of sixty-three with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
which he had entered upon this short, sharp, and decisive
campaign.</p>

<p>There was nothing for Grant to do now but build
bridges and follow. Before morning four bridges had
been thrown across the Big Black, and by the evening
of that day, the 18th, the army had arrived behind
Vicksburg, which was now its front. In twenty-four
hours after Grant's arrival the town was invested,
the bluffs above the town had been seized so that we
could get water from the Mississippi, and Haynes's Bluff
up the Yazoo had been abandoned by the Confederates.
With the Yazoo highlands in our control there was no
difficulty in establishing a line of supplies with our original
base on the Mississippi. On the 20th I was able
to get off to Mr. Stanton the first dispatch from the
rear of Vicksburg. In it I said, "Probably the town
will be carried to-day."</p>

<p>The prediction was not verified. The assault we
expected was not made until the morning of the 22d.
It failed, but without heavy loss. Early in the afternoon,
however, McClernand, who was on the left of
our lines, reported that he was in possession of two
forts of the rebel line, was hard pressed, and in great
need of re-enforcements. Not doubting that he had
really succeeded in taking and holding the works he
pretended to hold, General Grant sent a division to his
support, and at the same time ordered Sherman and
McPherson to make new attacks. McClernand's report
was false, for, although a few of his men had broken
through in one place, he had not taken a single fort, and
the result of the second assault was disastrous. We<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
were repulsed, losing quite heavily, when but for his
error the total loss of the day would have been inconsiderable.</p>

<p>The failure of the 22d convinced Grant of the
necessity of a regular siege, and immediately the army
settled down to that. We were in an incomparable
position for a siege as regarded the health and comfort
of our men. The high wooded hills afforded pure
air and shade, and the deep ravines abounded in springs
of excellent water, and if they failed it was easy to bring
it from the Mississippi. Our line of supplies was beyond
the reach of the enemy, and there was an abundance of
fruit all about us. I frequently met soldiers coming into
camp with buckets full of mulberries, blackberries, and
red and yellow wild plums.</p>

<p>The army was deployed at this time in the following
way: The right of the besieging force was held by General
Sherman, whose forces ran from the river along the
bluffs around the northeast of the town. Sherman's
front was at a greater distance from the enemy than that
of any other corps, and the approach less advantageous,
but he began his siege works with great energy and
admirable skill. Everything I saw of Sherman at the
Vicksburg siege increased my admiration for him. He
was a very brilliant man and an excellent commander
of a corps. Sherman's information was great, and he
was a clever talker. He always liked to have people
about who could keep up with his conversation; besides,
he was genial and unaffected. I particularly admired
his loyalty to Grant. He had criticised the plan of
campaign frankly in the first place, but had supported<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
every movement with all his energy, and now that we
were in the rear of Vicksburg he gave loud praise to the
commander in chief.</p>

<p>To the left of Sherman lay the Seventeenth Army
Corps, under Major-General J. B. McPherson. He was
one of the best officers we had. He was but thirty-two
years old at the time, and a very handsome, gallant-looking
man, with rather a dark complexion, dark eyes,
and a most cordial manner. McPherson was an engineer
officer of fine natural ability and extraordinary
acquirements, having graduated Number One in his
class at West Point, and was held in high estimation by
Grant and his professional brethren. Halleck gave him
his start in the civil war, and he had been with Grant
at Donelson and ever since. He was a man without
any pretensions, and always had a pleasant hand-shake
for you.</p>

<p>It is a little remarkable that the three chief figures in
this great Vicksburg campaign&mdash;Grant, Sherman, and
McPherson&mdash;were all born in Ohio. The utmost cordiality
and confidence existed between these three men,
and it always seemed to me that much of the success
achieved in these marches and battles was owing to this
very fact. There was no jealousy or bickering, and in
their unpretending simplicity they were as alike as three
peas. No country was ever more faithfully, unselfishly
served than was ours in the Vicksburg campaign by
these three Ohio officers.</p>

<p class='p2'>To McPherson's left was the Thirteenth Army
Corps, under Major-General John A. McClernand.
Next to Grant he was the ranking officer in the army.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
The approaches on his front were most favorable to us,
and the enemy's line of works evidently much the weakest
there, but he was very inefficient and slow in pushing
his siege operations. Grant had resolved on the
23d to relieve McClernand for his false dispatch of the
day before stating that he held two of the enemy's
forts, but he changed his mind, concluding that it would
be better on the whole to leave him in his command
till the siege was concluded. From the time that I
had joined Grant's army at Milliken's Bend and heard
him criticising Porter, Sherman, and other officers,
I had been observing McClernand narrowly myself.
My own judgment of him by this time was that he had
not the qualities necessary for commander even of a
regiment. In the first place, he was not a military man;
he was a politician and a member of Congress. He was
a man of a good deal of a certain kind of talent, not of a
high order, but not one of intellectual accomplishments.
His education was that which a man gets who is in
Congress five or six years. In short, McClernand was
merely a smart man, quick, very active-minded, but his
judgment was not solid, and he looked after himself a
good deal. Mr. Lincoln also looked out carefully for
McClernand, because he was an Illinois Democrat, with
a considerable following among the people. It was a
great thing to get McClernand into the war in the first
place, for his natural predisposition, one would have
supposed, would have been to sympathize with the
South. As long as he adhered to the war he carried
his Illinois constituency with him; and chiefly for this
reason, doubtless, Lincoln made it a point to take<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
special care of him. In doing this the President really
served the greater good of the cause. But from the
circumstances of Lincoln's supposed friendship, McClernand
had more consequence in the army than he deserved.</p>

Harrison Wilson&mdash;Two semi-official letters to Stanton&mdash;Character
sketches for the information of the President and Secretary&mdash;Mr.
Dana's early judgment of soldiers who afterward won
distinction.</p></div>


<p>Living at headquarters as I did throughout the siege
of Vicksburg, I soon became intimate with General
Grant, not only knowing every operation while it was
still but an idea, but studying its execution on the spot.
Grant was an uncommon fellow&mdash;the most modest, the
most disinterested, and the most honest man I ever
knew, with a temper that nothing could disturb, and a
judgment that was judicial in its comprehensiveness and
wisdom. Not a great man, except morally; not an
original or brilliant man, but sincere, thoughtful, deep,
and gifted with courage that never faltered; when the
time came to risk all, he went in like a simple-hearted,
unaffected, unpretending hero, whom no ill omens could
deject and no triumph unduly exalt. A social, friendly
man, too, fond of a pleasant joke and also ready with
one; but liking above all a long chat of an evening, and
ready to sit up with you all night, talking in the cool
breeze in front of his tent. Not a man of sentimentality,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
not demonstrative in friendship, but always holding to
his friends, and just even to the enemies he hated.</p>

<p>After Grant, I spent more time at Vicksburg with his
assistant adjutant general, Colonel John A. Rawlins, and
with Lieutenant-Colonel Wilson, than with anybody
else. Rawlins was one of the most valuable men in
the army, in my judgment. He had but a limited education,
which he had picked up at the neighbourhood
school and in Galena, Ill., near which place he was
born and where he had worked himself into the law;
but he had a very able mind, clear, strong, and not subject
to hysterics. He bossed everything at Grant's
headquarters. He had very little respect for persons, and
a rough style of conversation. I have heard him curse
at Grant when, according to his judgment, the general
was doing something that he thought he had better not
do. But he was entirely devoted to his duty, with the
clearest judgment, and perfectly fearless. Without him
Grant would not have been the same man. Rawlins
was essentially a good man, though he was one of the
most profane men I ever knew; there was no guile in
him&mdash;he was as upright and as genuine a character as I
ever came across.</p>

<p>James H. Wilson I had first met at Milliken's Bend,
when he was serving as chief topographical engineer
and assistant inspector general of the Army of the Tennessee.
He was a brilliant man intellectually, highly
educated, and thoroughly companionable. We became
warm friends at once, and were together a great deal
throughout the war. Rarely did Wilson go out on a
specially interesting tour of inspection that he did not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
invite me to accompany him, and I never failed, if I
were at liberty, to accept his invitations. Much of the
exact information about the condition of the works
which I was able to send to Mr. Stanton Wilson put in
my way.</p>

<p>I have already spoken of McClernand, Sherman, and
McPherson, Grant's three chief officers, but there were
many subordinate officers of value in his army, not a
few of whom became afterward soldiers of distinction.
At the request of Secretary Stanton, I had begun at
Vicksburg a series of semi-official letters, in which I
undertook to give my impressions of the officers in
Grant's army. These letters were designed to help Mr.
Lincoln and Mr. Stanton in forming their judgments of
the men. In order to set the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">personnel</i> of the commanding
force distinctly before the reader, I quote here one
of these letters, written at Cairo after the siege had
ended. It has never been published before, and it gives
my judgment at that time of the subordinate officers in
the Vicksburg campaign:</p>

<div class='letter'>

<p class='nr5right'>
<span class="smcap">Cairo, Ill.</span>, <i class='date'>July 12, 1863</i>.
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>: Your dispatch of June 29th, desiring
me to "continue my sketches," I have to-day seen for
the first time. It was sent down the river, but had not
arrived when I left Vicksburg on the 5th instant.</p>

<p>Let me describe the generals of division and brigade
in Grant's army in the order of the army corps
to which they are attached, beginning with the Thirteenth.</p>

<p>The most prominent officer of the Thirteenth Corps,
next to the commander of the corps, is Brigadier-General
A. P. Hovey. He is a lawyer of Indiana, and from
forty to forty-five years old. He is ambitious, active,
nervous, irritable, energetic, clear-headed, quick-witted,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>and prompt-handed. He works with all his might and
all his mind; and, unlike most volunteer officers, makes
it his business to learn the military profession just as if
he expected to spend his life in it. He distinguished
himself most honorably at Port Gibson and Champion's
Hill, and is one of the best officers in this army. He
is a man whose character will always command respect,
though he is too anxious about his personal renown
and his own advancement to be considered a first-rate
man morally, judged by the high standard of men like
Grant and Sherman.</p>

<p>Hovey's principal brigadiers are General McGinnis
and Colonel Slack. McGinnis is brave enough, but too
excitable. He lost his balance at Champion's Hill. He
is not likely ever to be more than a brigadier. Slack is
a solid, steady man, brave, thorough, and sensible, but
will never set the river afire. His education is poor, but
he would make a respectable brigadier general, and, I
know, hopes to be promoted.</p>

<p>Next to Hovey is Osterhaus. This general is universally
well spoken of. He is a pleasant, genial fellow,
brave and quick, and makes a first-rate report of a reconnoissance.
There is not another general in this
army who keeps the commander in chief so well informed
concerning whatever happens at his outposts.
As a disciplinarian he is not equal to Hovey, but is
much better than some others. On the battlefield he
lacks energy and concentrativeness. His brigade commanders
are all colonels, and I don't know much of
them.</p>

<p>The third division of the Thirteenth Corps is commanded
by General A. J. Smith, an old cavalry officer
of the regular service. He is intrepid to recklessness,
his head is clear though rather thick, his disposition
honest and manly, though given to boasting and self-exaggeration
of a gentle and innocent kind. His division
is well cared for, but is rather famous for slow
instead of rapid marching. McClernand, however, disliked
him, and kept him in the rear throughout the late
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>campaign. He is a good officer to command a division
in an army corps, but should not be intrusted with any
important independent command.</p>

<p>Smith's principal brigadier is General Burbridge,
whom I judge to be a mediocre officer, brave, rather
pretentious, a good fellow, not destined to greatness.</p>

<p>The fourth division in the Thirteenth Corps is General
Carr's. He has really been sick throughout the
campaign, and had leave to go home several weeks
since, but stuck it out till the surrender. This may
account for a critical, hang-back disposition which he
has several times exhibited. He is a man of more cultivation,
intelligence, and thought than his colleagues
generally. The discipline in his camps I have thought
to be poor and careless. He is brave enough, but lacks
energy and initiative.</p>

<p>Carr's brigadiers comprise General M. K. Lawler
and General Lee, of Kansas. Lawler weighs two hundred
and fifty pounds, is a Roman Catholic, and was a
Douglas Democrat, belongs in Shawneetown, Ill., and
served in the Mexican War. He is as brave as a lion,
and has about as much brains; but his purpose is always
honest, and his sense is always good. He is a
good disciplinarian and a first-rate soldier. He once
hung a man of his regiment for murdering a comrade,
without reporting the case to his commanding general
either before or after the hanging, but there was no
doubt the man deserved his fate. Grant has two or
three times gently reprimanded him for indiscretions,
but is pretty sure to go and thank him after a battle.
Carr's third brigadier I don't know.</p>

<p>In the Fifteenth Corps there are two major generals
who command divisions&mdash;namely, Steele and Blair&mdash;and
one brigadier, Tuttle. Steele has also been sick
through the campaign, but has kept constantly at his
post. He is a gentlemanly, pleasant fellow.... Sherman
has a high opinion of his capacity, and every one
says that he handles troops with great coolness and
skill in battle. To me his mind seems to work in a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>desultory way, like the mind of a captain of infantry
long habituated to garrison duty at a frontier post. He
takes things in bits, like a gossiping companion, and
never comprehensively and strongly, like a man of clear
brain and a ruling purpose. But on the whole I consider
him one of the best division generals in this army,
yet you can not rely on him to make a logical statement,
or to exercise any independent command.</p>

<p>Of Steele's brigadiers, Colonel Woods eminently deserves
promotion. A Hercules in form, in energy, and
in pertinacity, he is both safe and sure. Colonel Manter,
of Missouri, is a respectable officer. General Thayer is
a fair but not first-rate officer.</p>

<p>Frank Blair is about the same as an officer that he
is as a politician. He is intelligent, prompt, determined,
rather inclining to disorder, a poor disciplinarian, but a
brave fighter. I judge that he will soon leave the army,
and that he prefers his seat in Congress to his commission.</p>

<p>In Frank Blair's division there are two brigadier
generals, Ewing and Lightburne. Ewing seems to possess
many of the qualities of his father, whom you know
better than I do, I suppose. Lightburne has not served
long with this army, and I have had no opportunity
of learning his measure. Placed in a command during
the siege where General Sherman himself directed what
was to be done, he has had little to do. He seems to
belong to the heavy rather than the rapid department of
the forces.</p>

<p>Colonel Giles Smith is one of the very best brigadiers
in Sherman's corps, perhaps the best of all next to
Colonel Woods. He only requires the chance to develop
into an officer of uncommon power and usefulness.
There are plenty of men with generals' commissions
who in all military respects are not fit to tie his
shoes.</p>

<p>Of General Tuttle, who commands Sherman's third
division, I have already spoken, and need not here repeat
it. Bravery and zeal constitute his only qualifica<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>tions
for command. His principal brigadier is General
Mower, a brilliant officer, but not of large mental calibre.
Colonel Wood, who commands another of his
brigades, is greatly esteemed by General Grant, but I
do not know him; neither do I know the commander of
his third brigade.</p>

<p>Three divisions of the Sixteenth Corps have been
serving in Grant's army for some time past. They are
all commanded by brigadier generals, and the brigades
by colonels. The first of these divisions to arrive before
Vicksburg was Lauman's. This general got his promotion
by bravery on the field and Iowa political influence.
He is totally unfit to command&mdash;a very good man but a
very poor general. His brigade commanders are none
of them above mediocrity. The next division of the
Sixteenth Corps to join the Vicksburg army was General
Kimball's. He is not so bad a commander as Lauman,
but he is bad enough; brave, of course, but lacking
the military instinct and the genius of generalship. I
don't know any of his brigade commanders. The third
division of the Sixteenth Corps now near Vicksburg is
that of General W. S. Smith. He is one of the best
officers in that army. A rigid disciplinarian, his division
is always ready and always safe. A man of brains, a
hard worker, unpretending, quick, suggestive, he may
also be a little crotchety, for such is his reputation; but
I judge that he only needs the opportunity to render
great services. What his brigade commanders are
worth I can't say, but I am sure they have a first-rate
schoolmaster in him.</p>

<p>I now come to the Seventeenth Corps and to its
most prominent division general, Logan. This is a
man of remarkable qualities and peculiar character.
Heroic and brilliant, he is sometimes unsteady. Inspiring
his men with his own enthusiasm on the field of
battle, he is splendid in all its crash and commotion, but
before it begins he is doubtful of the result, and after it is
over he is fearful we may yet be beaten. A man of
instinct and not of reflection, his judgments are often
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>absurd, but his extemporaneous opinions are very apt
to be right. Deficient in education, he is full of generous
attachments and sincere animosities. On the whole,
few can serve the cause of the country more effectively
than he, and none serve it more faithfully.</p>

<p>Logan's oldest brigade commander is General John
D. Stevenson, of Missouri. He is a person of much
talent, but a grumbler. He was one of the oldest
colonels in the volunteer service, but because he had
always been an antislavery man all the others were
promoted before him. This is still one of his grounds
for discontent, and in addition younger brigadiers have
been put before him since. Thus the world will not
go to suit him. He has his own notions, too, of what
should be done on the field of battle, and General McPherson
has twice during this campaign had to rebuke
him very severely for his failure to come to time on
critical occasions.</p>

<p>Logan's second brigade is commanded by General
Leggett, of Ohio. This officer has distinguished himself
during the siege, and will be likely to distinguish
himself hereafter. He possesses a clear head, an equable
temper, and great propulsive power over his men. He
is also a hard worker, and whatever he touches goes
easily. The third brigade of this division has for a short
time been commanded by Colonel Force. I only know
that Logan, McPherson, and Grant all think well of
him.</p>

<p>Next in rank among McPherson's division generals
is McArthur. He has been in the reserve throughout
the campaign, and has had little opportunity of proving
his mettle. He is a shrewd, steady Scotchman, trustworthy
rather than brilliant, good at hard knocks, but
not a great commander. Two of his brigadiers, however,
have gained very honorable distinction in this
campaign, namely Crocker, who commanded Quinby's
division at Port Gibson, Raymond, Jackson, and
Champion's Hill, and Ransom. Crocker was sick
throughout, and, as soon as Quinby returned to his com<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>mand,
had to go away, and it is feared may never be
able to come back. He is an officer of great promise
and remarkable power. Ransom has commanded on
McPherson's right during the siege, and has exceeded
every other brigadier in the zeal, intelligence, and
efficiency with which his siege works were constructed
and pushed forward. At the time of the surrender his
trenches were so well completed that the engineers
agreed that they offered the best opportunity in the
whole of our lines for the advance of storming columns.
Captain Comstock told me that ten thousand men
could there be marched under cover up to the very
lines of the enemy. In the assault of May 22d, Ransom
was equally conspicuous for the bravery with which he
exposed himself. No young man in all this army has
more future than he.</p>

<p>The third brigade of McArthur's division, that of
General Reid, has been detached during the campaign
at Lake Providence and elsewhere, and I have not been
able to make General R.'s acquaintance.</p>

<p>The third division of the Seventeenth Corps was
commanded during the first of the siege by General
Quinby. This officer was also sick, and I dare say did
not do justice to himself. A good commander of a
division he is not, though he is a most excellent and
estimable man, and seemed to be regarded by the soldiers
with much affection. But he lacks order, system,
command, and is the very opposite of his successor,
General John E. Smith, who, with much less intellect
than Quinby, has a great deal better sense, with a firmness
of character, a steadiness of hand, and a freedom
from personal irritability and jealousy which must soon
produce the happiest effect upon the division. Smith
combines with these natural qualities of a soldier and
commander a conscientious devotion not merely to the
doing but also to the learning of his duty, which renders
him a better and better general every day. He is also fit
to be intrusted with any independent command where
judgment and discretion are as necessary as courage
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>and activity, for in him all these qualities seem to be
happily blended and balanced.</p>

<p>Of General Matthias, who commands the brigade
in this division so long and so gallantly commanded
by the late Colonel Boomer, I hear the best accounts,
but do not know him personally. The medical inspector
tells me that no camps in the lines are kept in
so good condition as his; and General Sherman, under
whom he lately served, speaks of him as a very valuable
officer. The second brigade is commanded by Colonel
Sanborn, a steady, mediocre sort of man; the third by
Colonel Holmes, whom I don't know personally, but
who made a noble fight at Champion's Hill, and saved
our center there from being broken.</p>

<p>General Herron's division is the newest addition to
the forces under Grant, except the Ninth Corps, of
which I know nothing except that its discipline and
organization exceed those of the Western troops. Herron
is a driving, energetic sort of young fellow, not
deficient either in self-esteem or in common sense, and,
as I judge, hardly destined to distinctions higher than
those he has already acquired. Of his two brigadiers,
Vandever has not proved himself of much account during
the siege; Orme I have seen, but do not know.
Herron has shown a great deal more both of capacity
and force than either of them. But he has not the first
great requisite of a soldier, obedience to orders, and
believes too much in doing things his own way. Thus,
for ten days after he had taken his position he disregarded
the order properly to picket the bottom between
the bluff and the river on his left. He had made up
his own mind that nobody could get out of the town by
that way, and accordingly neglected to have the place
thoroughly examined in order to render the matter
clear and certain. Presently Grant discovered that men
from the town were making their escape through that
bottom, and then a more peremptory command to Herron
set the matter right by the establishment of the
necessary pickets.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span></p>
<p>I must not omit a general who formerly commanded
a brigade in Logan's division, and has for some time
been detached to a separate command at Milliken's
Bend. I mean General Dennis. He is a hard-headed,
hard-working, conscientious man, who never knows
when he is beaten, and consequently is very hard to
beat. He is not brilliant, but safe, sound, and trustworthy.
His predecessor in that command, General
Sullivan, has for some time been at Grant's headquarters,
doing nothing with more energy and effect than he
would be likely to show in any other line of duty. He
is a gentlemanly fellow, intelligent, a charming companion,
but heavy, jovial, and lazy.</p>

<p>I might write another letter on the staff officers and
staff organization of Grant's army, should you desire it.</p>

<p class='nr5right'>
Yours faithfully,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span class="smcap">C. A. Dana</span>.</p>
<p class='nr3left'>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Stanton.</span>
</p></div>

<p>The day after sending to Mr. Stanton this letter on
the generals of divisions and of brigades in the army
which besieged Vicksburg, I wrote him another on the
staff officers of the various corps. Like its predecessor,
this letter has never appeared in the records of the war:</p>

<div class='letter'>

<p class='nr5right'>
<span class="smcap">Cairo, Ill.</span>, <i class='date'>July 13, 1863</i>.
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>: In my letter of yesterday I accidentally
omitted to notice General C. C. Washburn among the
generals of division in Grant's army. He is now in
command of two of the divisions detached from the
Sixteenth Army Corps&mdash;namely, that of Kimball and
that of W. S. Smith&mdash;and, as I happen to know, is
anxious to be put in command of an army corps, for
which purpose it has been suggested that a new corps
might be created out of these two divisions, with the
addition of that of Lauman, also detached from the Sixteenth,
or that of Herron. But I understand from General
Grant that he is not favorable to any such arrangement.
Washburn being one of the very youngest in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>rank of his major generals, he intends to put him in
command of a single division as soon as possible, in
order that he may prove his fitness for higher commands
by actual service, and give no occasion for older
soldiers to complain that he is promoted without regard
to his merits.</p>

<p>I know Washburn very well, both as a politician and
a military man, and I say frankly that he has better
qualities for the latter than for the former function. He
is brave, steady, respectable; receives suggestions and
weighs them carefully; is not above being advised, but
acts with independence nevertheless. His judgment is
good, and his vigilance sufficient. I have not seen him
in battle, however, and can not say how far he holds
his mind there. I don't find in him, I am sorry to say,
that effort to learn the military art which every commander
ought to exhibit, no matter whether he has received
a military education or not. Washburn's whole
soul is not put into the business of arms, and for me
that is an unpardonable defect. But he is a good man,
and above the average of our generals, at least of those
in Grant's command.</p>

<p>I now come to the staff organization and staff
officers of this army, beginning, of course, with those
connected with the head of the department. Grant's
staff is a curious mixture of good, bad, and indifferent.
As he is neither an organizer nor a disciplinarian himself,
his staff is naturally a mosaic of accidental elements
and family friends. It contains four working men, two
who are able to accomplish their duties without much
work, and several who either don't think of work, or
who accomplish nothing no matter what they undertake.</p>

<p>Lieutenant-Colonel Rawlins, Grant's assistant adjutant
general, is a very industrious, conscientious man,
who never loses a moment, and never gives himself any
indulgence except swearing and scolding. He is a
lawyer by profession, a townsman of Grant's, and has a
great influence over him, especially because he watches
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>him day and night, and whenever he commits the folly
of tasting liquor hastens to remind him that at the beginning
of the war he gave him [Rawlins] his word of
honor not to touch a drop as long as it lasted. Grant
thinks Rawlins a first-rate adjutant, but I think this is a
mistake. He is too slow, and can't write the English
language correctly without a great deal of careful consideration.
Indeed, illiterateness is a general characteristic
of Grant's staff, and in fact of Grant's generals
and regimental officers of all ranks.</p>

<p>Major Bowers, judge-advocate of Grant's staff, is
an excellent man, and always finds work to do. Lieutenant-Colonel
Wilson, inspector general, is a person
of similar disposition. He is a captain of engineers in
the regular army, and has rendered valuable services in
that capacity. The fortifications of Haynes's Bluff were
designed by him and executed under his direction. His
leading idea is the idea of duty, and he applies it vigorously
and often impatiently to others. In consequence
he is unpopular among all who like to live
with little work. But he has remarkable talents and
uncommon executive power, and will be heard from
hereafter.</p>

<p>The quartermaster's department is under charge of
Lieutenant-Colonel Bingham, who is one of those I
spoke of as accomplishing much with little work. He
is an invalid almost, and I have never seen him when he
appeared to be perfectly well; but he is a man of first-rate
abilities and solid character, and, barring physical weakness,
up to even greater responsibilities than those he
now bears.</p>

<p>The chief commissary, Lieutenant-Colonel Macfeely,
is a jolly, agreeable fellow, who never seems
to be at work, but I have heard no complaints of deficiencies
in his department. On the contrary, it seems
to be one of the most efficacious parts of this great
machine.</p>

<p>Lieutenant-Colonel Kent, provost-marshal general,
is a very industrious and sensible man, a great improve<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>ment
on his predecessor, Colonel Hillyer, who was a
family and personal friend of Grant's.</p>

<p>There are two aides-de-camp with the rank of
colonel, namely, Colonel &mdash;&mdash; and Colonel &mdash;&mdash;, both
personal friends of Grant's. &mdash;&mdash; is a worthless,
whisky-drinking, useless fellow. &mdash;&mdash; is decent and
gentlemanly, but neither of them is worth his salt so
far as service to the Government goes. Indeed, in all
my observation, I have never discovered the use of
Grant's aides-de-camp at all. On the battlefield he
sometimes sends orders by them, but everywhere else
they are idle loafers. I suppose the army would be
better off if they were all suppressed, especially the
colonels.</p>

<p>Grant has three aides with the rank of captain. Captain &mdash;&mdash; is
a relative of Mrs. Grant. He has been a
stage driver, and violates English grammar at every
phrase. He is of some use, for he attends to the mails.
Captain &mdash;&mdash; is an elegant young officer of the regular
cavalry. He rides after the general when he rides out;
the rest of the time he does nothing at all. Captain
Badeau, wounded at Port Hudson since he was attached
to Grant's staff, has not yet reported.</p>

<p>I must not omit the general medical staff of this
army. It is in bad order. Its head, Dr. Mills, is impracticable,
earnest, quarrelsome. He was relieved several
weeks since, but Grant likes him, and kept him on
till the fall of Vicksburg. In this he was right, no doubt,
for a change during the siege would have been troublesome.
The change, I presume, will now be made. It
must be for the better.</p>

<p>The office of chief of artillery on the general staff
I had forgotten, as well as that of chief engineer. The
former is occupied by Lieutenant-Colonel Duff, of the
Second Illinois Artillery. He is unequal to the position,
not only because he is disqualified by sickness, but because
he does not sufficiently understand the management
of artillery. The siege suffered greatly from his
incompetence. General Grant knows, of course, that he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>is not the right person; but it is one of his weaknesses
that he is unwilling to hurt the feelings of a friend, and
so he keeps him on.</p>

<p>The chief engineer, Captain Comstock, is an officer
of great merit. He has, too, what his predecessor, Captain
Prime, lacked, a talent for organization. His accession
to the army will be the source of much improvement.</p>

<p>If General Grant had about him a staff of thoroughly
competent men, disciplinarians and workers, the
efficiency and fighting quality of his army would soon
be much increased. As it is, things go too much by
hazard and by spasms; or, when the pinch comes, Grant
forces through, by his own energy and main strength,
what proper organization and proper staff officers
would have done already.</p>

<p>The staff of the Thirteenth Corps was formed by
General McClernand. The acting adjutant general,
Lieutenant-Colonel Scates, is a man of about fifty-five
or sixty years old; he was a judge in Illinois, and left an
honored and influential social position to serve in the
army. General Ord speaks in high terms of him as an
officer. The chief of artillery, Colonel &mdash;&mdash;, is an ass.
The chief quartermaster, Lieutenant-Colonel &mdash;&mdash;,
General McClernand's father-in-law, lately resigned his
commission. He was incompetent.... His successor
has not yet been appointed. The chief commissary,
Lieutenant-Colonel &mdash;&mdash;, is a fussy fellow, who with
much show accomplishes but little. General McClernand's
aides went away with him or are absent on
leave. Not a man of them is worth having. The engineer
on his staff, Lieutenant Hains, is an industrious
and useful officer. The medical director, Dr. Hammond,
had just been appointed.</p>

<p>In the Fifteenth Corps staff all have to be working
men, for Sherman tolerates no idlers and finds something
for everybody to do. If an officer proves unfit
for his position, he shifts him to some other place.
Thus his adjutant, Lieutenant-Colonel Hammond, a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>restless Kentuckian, kept everything in a row as long as
he remained in that office. Sherman has accordingly
made him inspector general, and during the last two
months has kept him constantly employed on scouting
parties. In his place as adjutant is Captain Sawyer, a
quiet, industrious, efficient person. The chief of artillery,
Major Taylor, directed by Sherman's omnipresent
eye and quick judgment, is an officer of great value,
though under another general he might not be worth
so much. The chief engineer, Captain Pitzman,
wounded about July 15th, is a man of merit, and his
departure was a great loss to the regular ranks. General
Sherman has three aides-de-camp, Captain McCoy,
Captain Dayton, and Lieutenant Hill, and, as I have
said, neither of them holds a sinecure office. His medical
director, Dr. McMillan, is a good physician, I believe;
he has been in a constant contention with Dr.
Mills. The quartermaster, Lieutenant-Colonel J. C.
Smith, is a most efficient officer; he has been doing duty
as commissary also.</p>

<p>On the whole, General Sherman has a very small
and very efficient staff; but the efficiency comes mainly
from him. What a splendid soldier he is!</p>

<p>The staff of the Seventeenth Army Corps is the
most complete, the most numerous, and in some respects
the most serviceable in this army.</p>

<p>The adjutant general, Lieutenant-Colonel Clark, is
a person of uncommon quickness, is always at work, and
keeps everything in his department in first-rate order.
The inspector general, Lieutenant-Colonel Strong, does
his duties with promptness and thoroughness; his reports
are models. The chief of artillery, Lieutenant-Colonel
Powell, thoroughly understands his business,
and attends to it diligently. The provost-marshal general,
Lieutenant-Colonel Wilson, is a judicious and industrious
man. Both the quartermaster and commissary
are new men, captains, and I do not know them,
but McPherson speaks highly of them. The medical
director, Dr. Boucher, has the reputation of keeping his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>hospitals in better order and making his reports more
promptly and satisfactorily than any other medical
officer in this army. General McPherson has four aides-de-camp:
Captain Steele, Captain Gile, Lieutenant
Knox, and Lieutenant Vernay. The last of these is
the best, and Captain Steele is next to him. The engineer
officer, Captain Hickenlooper, is a laborious
man, quick, watchful, but not of great capacity. The
picket officer, Major Willard, whom I accidentally name
last, is a person of unusual merit.</p>

<p>In the staffs of the division and brigadier generals
I do not now recall any officer of extraordinary capacity.
There may be such, but I have not made their acquaintance.
On the other hand, I have made the acquaintance
of some who seemed quite unfit for their places.
I must not omit, however, to speak here of Captain
Tresilian, engineer on the staff of Major-General
Logan. His general services during the siege were not
conspicuous, but he deserves great credit for constructing
the wooden mortars which General McPherson
used near its close with most remarkable effect. Both
the idea and the work were Tresilian's.</p>

<p>Very possibly you may not wish to go through this
mass of details respecting so many officers of inferior
grades, upon whose claims you may never be called to
pass judgment. But if you care to read them here they
are. I remain, dear sir,</p>

<h3>THE SIEGE OF VICKSBURG</h3>

<div class='intro'>

fruitless appeal to General Banks&mdash;Mr. Stanton responds to
Mr. Dana's representations&mdash;A steamboat trip with Grant&mdash;Watching
Joe Johnston&mdash;Visits to Sherman and Admiral Porter&mdash;The

<p>We had not been many days in the rear of Vicksburg
before we settled into regular habits. The men
were detailed in reliefs for work in the trenches, and being
relieved at fixed hours everybody seemed to lead a
systematic life.</p>

<p>My chief duty throughout the siege was a daily
round through the trenches, generally with the corps
commander or some one of his staff. As the lines of
investment were six or seven miles long, it occupied the
greater part of my day; sometimes I made a portion
of my tour of inspection in the night. One night in
riding through the trenches I must have passed twenty
thousand men asleep on their guns. I still can see the
grotesque positions into which they had curled themselves.
The trenches were so protected that there was
no danger in riding through them. It was not so safe
to venture on the hills overlooking Vicksburg. I went
on foot and alone one day to the top of a hill, and was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
looking at the town, when I suddenly heard something
go whizz, whizz, by my ear. "What in the world is
that?" I asked myself. The place was so desolate that
it was an instant before I could believe that these were
bullets intended for me. When I did realize it, I immediately
started to lie down. Then came the question,
which was the best way to lie down. If I lay at right
angles to the enemy's line the bullets from the right and
left might strike me; if I lay parallel to it then those
directly from the front might hit me. So I concluded it
made no difference which way I lay. After remaining
quiet for a time the bullets ceased, and I left the hill-top.
I was more cautious in the future in venturing beyond
cover.</p>

<p>Through the entire siege I lived in General Grant's
headquarters, which were on a high bluff northeast of
Sherman's extreme left. I had a tent to myself, and
on the whole was very comfortable. We never lacked
an abundance of provisions. There was good water,
enough even for the bath, and we suffered very little
from excessive heat. The only serious annoyance was
the cannonade from our whole line, which from the
first of June went on steadily by night as well as by day.
The following bit from a letter I wrote on June 2d, to
my little daughter, tells something of my situation:</p>

<div class='letter'>

<p>It is real summer weather here, and, after coming
in at noon to-day from my usual ride through the
trenches, I was very glad to get a cold bath in my tent
before dinner. I like living in tents very well, especially
if you ride on horseback all day. Every night I sleep
with one side of the tent wide open and the walls put
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>up all around to get plenty of air. Sometimes I wake
up in the night and think it is raining, the wind roars
so in the tops of the great oak forest on the hillside
where we are encamped, and I think it is thundering
till I look out and see the golden moonlight in all its
glory, and listen again and know that it is only the
thunder of General Sherman's great guns, that neither
rest nor let others rest by night or by day.</p></div>

<p>We were no sooner in position behind Vicksburg
than Grant saw that he must have reinforcements. Joe
Johnston was hovering near, working with energy to
collect forces sufficient to warrant an attempt to relieve
Vicksburg. The Confederates were also known to be
reorganizing at Jackson. Johnston eventually gathered
an army behind Grant of about twenty-five thousand
men.</p>

<p>Under these threatening circumstances it was necessary
to keep a certain number of troops in our rear,
more than Grant could well spare from the siege, and
he therefore made every effort to secure reinforcements.
He ordered down from Tennessee, and elsewhere in his
own department, all available forces. He also sent to
General Banks, who was then besieging Port Hudson,
a request to bring his forces up as promptly as practicable,
and assuring him that he (Grant) would gladly
serve under him as his senior in rank, or simply co-operate
with him for the benefit of the common cause,
if Banks preferred that arrangement. To Halleck, on
May 29th, he telegraphed: "If Banks does not come to
my assistance I must be reinforced from elsewhere. I
will avoid a surprise, and do the best I can with the
means at hand." This was about the extent of Grant's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
personal appeals to his superiors for additional forces.
No doubt, however, he left a good deal to my representations.</p>

<p>As no reply came from Banks, I started myself on
the 30th for Port Hudson at Grant's desire, to urge
that the reinforcements be furnished.</p>

<p>The route used for getting out from the rear of
Vicksburg at that time was through the Chickasaw
Bayou into the Yazoo and thence into the Mississippi.
From the mouth of the Yazoo I crossed the Mississippi
to Young's Point, and from there went overland across
the peninsula to get a gunboat at a point south of
Vicksburg. As we were going down the river we met
a steamer just above Grand Gulf bearing one of the
previous messengers whom Grant had sent to Banks.
He was bringing word that Banks could send no forces;
on the other hand, he asked reinforcements from Grant
to aid in his siege of Port Hudson, which he had closely
invested. This news, of course, made my trip unnecessary,
and I returned at once to headquarters, having
been gone not over twenty-four hours.</p>

<p>As soon as this news came from Banks, I sent an
urgent appeal to Mr. Stanton to hurry reinforcements
sufficient to make success beyond all peradventure.
The Government was not slow to appreciate Grant's
needs or the great opportunity he had created. Early
in June I received the following dispatch from Mr.
Stanton:</p>

<div class='letter'>

<p class='nr5right'>
<span class="smcap">War Department</span>, <i class='date'>June 5, 1863</i>.
</p>

<p>Your telegrams up to the 30th have been received.
Everything in the power of this Government will be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>put forth to aid General Grant. The emergency is not
underrated here. Your telegrams are a great obligation,
and are looked for with deep interest. I can not
thank you as much as I feel for the service you are now
rendering. You have been appointed an assistant adjutant
general, with rank of major, with liberty to report
to General Grant if he needs you. The appointment
may be a protection to you. I shall expect daily
reports if possible.</p>

<p class='nr9right'>
<span class="smcap">Edwin M. Stanton</span>,</p>
<p class='nr5right'><i class='title'>Secretary of War</i>.</p>
<p class='nr3left'>
<span class="smcap">C. A. Dana</span>, Esq.,</p>
<p class='nr3left'>Grant's Headquarters near Vicksburg.
</p></div>

<p>My appointment as assistant adjutant general was
Stanton's own idea. He was by nature a very anxious
man. When he perceived from my dispatches that I
was going every day on expeditions into dangerous territory,
he became alarmed lest I might be caught by the
Confederates; for as I was a private citizen it would
have been difficult to exchange me. If I were in the
regular volunteer service as an assistant adjutant general,
however, there would be no trouble about an exchange,
hence my appointment.</p>

<p>The chief variations from my business of watching
the siege behind Vicksburg were these trips I made to
inspect the operations against the enemy, who was now
trying to shut us in from the rear beyond the Big Black.
His heaviest force was to the northeast. On June 6th
the reports from Satartia, our advance up the Yazoo,
were so unsatisfactory that Grant decided to examine
the situation there himself. That morning he said to
me at breakfast:</p>

<p>"Mr. Dana, I am going to Satartia to-day; would
you like to go along?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span></p>

<p>I said I would, and we were soon on horseback,
riding with a cavalry guard to Haynes's Bluff, where we
took a small steamer reserved for Grant's use and carrying
his flag. Grant was ill and went to bed soon after
he started. We had gone up the river to within two
miles of Satartia, when we met two gunboats coming
down. Seeing the general's flag, the officers in charge
of the gunboats came aboard our steamer and asked
where the general was going. I told them to Satartia.</p>

<p>"Why," said they, "it will not be safe. Kimball
[our advance was under the charge of Brigadier-General
Nathan Kimball, Third Division, Sixteenth Army
Corps] has retreated from there, and is sending all his
supplies to Haynes's Bluff. The enemy is probably in
the town now."</p>

<p>I told them Grant was sick and asleep, and that I
did not want to waken him. They insisted that it was
unsafe to go on, and that I would better call the general.
Finally I did so, but he was too sick to decide.</p>

<p>"I will leave it with you," he said. I immediately
said we would go back to Haynes's Bluff, which we did.</p>

<p>The next morning Grant came out to breakfast fresh
as a rose, clean shirt and all, quite himself. "Well, Mr.
Dana," he said, "I suppose we are at Satartia now."</p>

<p>"No, general," I said, "we are at Haynes's Bluff."
And I told him what had happened.</p>

<p>He did not complain, but as he was short of officers
at that point he asked me to go with a party of cavalry
toward Mechanicsburg to find if it were true, as reported,
that Joe Johnston was advancing from Canton
to the Big Black. We had a hard ride, not getting back<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
to Vicksburg until the morning of the eighth. The
country was like all the rest around Vicksburg, broken,
wooded, unpopulous, with bad roads and few streams.
It still had many cattle, but the corn was pretty thoroughly
cleared out. We found that Johnston had not
moved his main force as rumored, and that he could not
move it without bringing all his supplies with him.</p>

<p>Throughout the siege an attack from Johnston continued
to threaten Grant and to keep a part of our army
busy. Almost every one of my dispatches to Mr. Stanton
contained rumors of the movements of the Confederates,
and the information was so uncertain that
often what I reported one day had to be contradicted
the next. About the 15th of June the movements of
the enemy were so threatening that Grant issued an
order extending Sherman's command so as to include
Haynes's Bluff, and to send there the two divisions of
the Ninth Corps under General Parke. These troops
had just arrived from Kentucky, and Grant had intended
to place them on the extreme left of our besieging line.</p>

<p>Although our spies brought in daily reports of forces
of the enemy at different points between Yazoo City
and Jackson, Johnston's plan did not develop opportunity
until the 22d, when he was said to be crossing
the Big Black north of Bridgeport. Sherman immediately
started to meet him with about thirty thousand
troops, including cavalry. Five brigades more
were held in readiness to reinforce him if necessary.
The country was scoured by Sherman in efforts to beat
Johnston, but no trace of an enemy was found. It was,
however, ascertained that he had not advanced, but was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
still near Canton. As there was no design to attack
Johnston until Vicksburg was laid low, Sherman made
his way to Bear Creek, northwest of Canton, where he
could watch the Confederates, and there went into
camp.</p>

<p>I went up there several times to visit him, and always
came away enthusiastic over his qualities as a soldier.
His amazing activity and vigilance pervaded his entire
force. The country where he had encamped was exceedingly
favorable for defense. He had occupied the
commanding points, opened rifle-pits wherever they
would add to his advantage, obstructed the cross-roads
and most of the direct roads also, and ascertained every
point where the Big Black could be forded between the
line of Benton on the north and the line of railroads
on the south. By his rapid movements, also, and by
widely deploying on all the ridges and open headlands,
Sherman produced the impression that his forces were
ten times as numerous as they really were. Sherman
remained in his camp on Bear Creek through the rest of
the siege, in order to prevent any possible attack by Joe
Johnston, the reports about whose movements continued
to be contradictory and uncertain.</p>

<p>Another variation in my Vicksburg life was visiting
Admiral Porter, who commanded the fleet which
hemmed in the city on the river-side. Porter was a very
active, courageous, fresh-minded man, and an experienced
naval officer, and I enjoyed the visits I made to
his fleet. His boats were pretty well scattered, for the
Confederates west of the Mississippi were pressing in,
and unless watched might manage to cross somewhere.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
Seven of the gunboats were south of Vicksburg, one at
Haynes's Bluff, one was at Chickasaw Bayou, one at
Young's Point, one at Milliken's Bend, one at Lake
Providence, one at Greenell, one at Island Sixty-five,
two were at White River, and so on, and several were
always in motion. They guarded the river so completely
that no hostile movement from the west ever
succeeded, or was likely to do so.</p>

<p>The most serious attack from the west during the
siege was that on June 7th, when a force of some two
thousand Confederates engaged about a thousand
negro troops defending Milliken's Bend. This engagement
at Milliken's Bend became famous from the conduct
of the colored troops. General E. S. Dennis, who
saw the battle, told me that it was the hardest fought
engagement he had ever seen. It was fought mainly
hand to hand. After it was over many men were found
dead with bayonet stabs, and others with their skulls
broken open by butts of muskets. "It is impossible,"
said General Dennis, "for men to show greater gallantry
than the negro troops in that fight."</p>

<p>The bravery of the blacks in the battle at Milliken's
Bend completely revolutionized the sentiment of the
army with regard to the employment of negro troops.
I heard prominent officers who formerly in private had
sneered at the idea of the negroes fighting express
themselves after that as heartily in favor of it. Among
the Confederates, however, the feeling was very different.
All the reports which came to us showed that
both citizens and soldiers on the Confederate side manifested
great dismay at the idea of our arming negroes.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
They said that such a policy was certain to be followed
by insurrection with all its horrors.</p>

<p>Although the presence of Joe Johnston on the east,
and the rumors of invasion by Kirby Smith from the
west, compelled constant attention, the real work behind
Vicksburg was always that of the siege. No
amount of outside alarm loosened Grant's hold on the
rebel stronghold. The siege went on steadily and
effectively. By June 10th the expected reinforcements
began to report. Grant soon had eighty-five thousand
men around Vicksburg, and Pemberton's last hope was
gone. The first troops to arrive were eight regiments
under General Herron. They came from Missouri,
down the Mississippi to Young's Point, where they were
debarked and marched across the peninsula, care being
taken, of course, that the Confederate garrison at Vicksburg
should see the whole march. The troops were
then ferried across the Mississippi, and took a position
south of Vicksburg between Lauman's troops and the
Mississippi River, completely closing the lines, and thus
finally rendering egress and ingress absolutely impossible.
Herron took this position on June 13th. He
went to work with so much energy that on the night
of the 15th he was able to throw forward his lines on
his left, making an advance of five hundred yards, and
bringing his artillery and rifle-pits within two or three
hundred yards of the enemy's lines.</p>

<p>Herron was a first-rate officer, and the only consummate
dandy I ever saw in the army. He was always
handsomely dressed; I believe he never went out without
patent-leather boots on, and you would see him in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
the middle of a battle&mdash;well, I can not say exactly that
he went into battle with a lace pocket-handkerchief, but
at all events he always displayed a clean white one. But
these little vanities appeared not to detract from his
usefulness. Herron had already proved his ability and
fighting qualities at the battle of Prairie Grove, December
7, 1862.</p>

<p>Just as our reinforcements arrived we began to receive
encouraging reports from within Vicksburg. Deserters
said that the garrison was worn out and hungry;
besides, the defense had for several days been conducted
with extraordinary feebleness, which Grant thought was
due to the deficiency of ammunition or to exhaustion
and depression in the garrison, or to their retirement
to an inner line of defense. The first and third of these
causes no doubt operated to some extent, but the second
we supposed to be the most influential. The deserters
also said that fully one third of the garrison were
in hospital, and that officers, as well as men, had begun
to despair of relief from Johnston.</p>

<p>These reports from within the town, as well as the
progress of the siege and the arrival of reinforcements,
pointed so strongly to the speedy surrender of the place
that I asked Mr. Stanton in my dispatch of June 14th
to please inform me by telegram whether he wished me
to go to General Rosecrans after the fall of Vicksburg
or whether he had other orders for me.</p>

<p>The next day after this letter, however, the enemy
laid aside his long-standing inactivity and opened violently
with both artillery and musketry. Two mortars
which the Confederates got into operation that day in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
front of General A. J. Smith particularly interested our
generals. I remember going with a party of some
twenty officers, including Sherman, Ord, McPherson,
and Wilson, to the brow of a hill on McPherson's front
to watch this battery with our field glasses. From
where we were we could study the whole operation.
We saw the shell start from the mortar, sail slowly
through the air toward us, fall to the ground and explode,
digging out a hole which looked like a crater. I
remember one of these craters which must have been
nine feet in diameter. As you watched a shell coming
you could not tell whether it would fall a thousand feet
away or by your side. Yet nobody budged. The men
sat there on their horses, their reins loose, studying and
discussing the work of the batteries, apparently indifferent
to the danger. It was very interesting as a study
of human steadiness.</p>

<p>By the middle of June our lines were so near the
enemy's on Sherman's and McPherson's front that
General Grant began to consider the project of another
general assault as soon as McClernand's, Lauman's, and
Herron's lines were brought up close. Accordingly,
Sherman and McPherson were directed to hold their
work until the others were up to them. Herron, of
course, had not had time to advance, though since his
arrival he had worked with great energy. Lauman had
done little in the way of regular approaches. But the
chief difficulty in the way was the backwardness of McClernand.
His trenches were mere rifle-pits, three or
four feet wide, and would allow neither the passage of
artillery nor the assemblage of any considerable number<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
of troops. His batteries were, with scarcely an exception,
in the position they apparently had held when the
siege was opened.</p>

<p class='p2'>This obstacle to success was soon removed. On the
18th of June McClernand was relieved and General Ord
was put into his place. The immediate occasion of McClernand's
removal was a congratulatory address to the
Thirteenth Corps which he had fulminated in May,
and which first reached the besieging army in a copy
of the Missouri Democrat. In this extraordinary address
McClernand claimed for himself most of the glory
of the campaign, reaffirmed that on May 22d he had
held two rebel forts for several hours, and imputed to
other officers and troops failure to support him in their
possession, which must have resulted in the capture of
the town, etc. Though this congratulatory address was
the occasion of McClernand's removal, the real causes
of it dated farther back. These causes, as I understood
at the time, were his repeated disobedience of important
orders, his general unfortunate mental disposition, and
his palpable incompetence for the duties of his position.
I learned in private conversation that in General Grant's
judgment it was necessary that McClernand should be
removed for the reason, above all, that his bad relations
with other corps commanders, especially Sherman and
McPherson, rendered it impossible that the chief command
of the army should devolve upon him, as it would
have done were General Grant disabled, without some
pernicious consequence to the Union cause.</p>

<h3>PEMBERTON'S SURRENDER.</h3>

<div class='intro'>

<p>The artillery assault of June 20&mdash;McPherson springs a mine&mdash;Grant
decides to storm the city&mdash;Pemberton asks for an interview and
terms&mdash;The "unconditional surrender" note&mdash;At the meeting of
Grant and Pemberton between the lines&mdash;The ride into Vicksburg
and the Fourth of July celebration there.</p></div>


<p>Two days after McClernand's removal General
Grant attempted to settle the question whether he
should make a further attempt to storm Vicksburg or
leave its reduction to the regular progress of siege operations.
To test what an assault would do, he began,
at four o'clock on the morning of June 20th, an artillery
attack, in which about two hundred cannon were
engaged. During the attack no Confederates were
visible, nor was any reply made to our artillery. Their
musketry fire also amounted to nothing. Of course,
some damage was done to the buildings of the town by
our concentrated cannonade, but we could not tell
whether their mills, foundry, or storehouses were destroyed.
Their rifle-pits and defenses were little injured.
At ten o'clock the cannonade ceased. It was
evident that the probabilities of immediate success by
assault would not compensate for the sacrifices.</p>

<p>After the artillery attack on the 20th, the next exciting
incident of the siege was the springing of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
mine by McPherson. Directly in front of his position
the enemy had a great fort which was regarded as the
key of their line. As soon as McPherson had got into
position behind Vicksburg he had begun to run trenches
toward this fort, under which he subsequently tunneled,
hoping that by an explosion he would open it to our
occupation. The mine was sprung about four o'clock
on the afternoon of June 25th. It was charged with
twelve hundred pounds of powder. The explosion was
terrific, forming a crater fully thirty-five feet in diameter,
but it did not open the fort. There still remained
between the new ground which we had gained by the
explosion and the main works of the fort an ascent so
steep that an assault was practically impossible. The
enemy very soon opened a galling fire from within the
fort with shells with short fuses, thrown over the ridge
by hand, like grenades, and these did some execution.
The wounds inflicted by these missiles were frightful.
To this we replied as actively as possible, and this conflict
between parties invisible to each other, not only
on account of the darkness, but also on account of the
barrier between them, was kept up with fury during
the night and the next forenoon. Immediately on the
springing of the mine a tremendous cannonade was
opened along our whole line, accompanied by active
firing from the rifle-pits. This fire was continued with
little relaxation during the night and the next day.
After several days of this kind of warfare, we had made
no progress whatever, not being able either to plant a
battery or to open a rifle-pit upon the new ground.</p>

<p>Eventually McPherson completed another mine,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
which he exploded on the first day of July. Many Confederates
were killed, and six were thrown over into
our lines by the explosion. They were all dead but
one, a negro, who got well and joined our army. McPherson
did not, however, get possession of the place
through this mine, as he had hoped.</p>

<p>Little advancement was made in the siege after McPherson
sprang his first mine on the 25th of June,
except in the matter of time and in the holding of the
lines of investment. Several things conspired to produce
inactivity and a sort of listlessness among the various
commands&mdash;the heat of the weather, the unexpected
length of the siege, the endurance of the defense,
the absence of any thorough organization of the engineer
department, and, above all, the well-grounded
general belief of our officers and men that the town must
presently fall through starvation, without any special
effort or sacrifice. This belief was founded on the reports
from within Vicksburg. Every new party of
deserters which reached us agreed that the provisions
of the place were near the point of total exhaustion,
that rations had been reduced lower than ever, that extreme
dissatisfaction existed among the garrison, and it
was generally expected&mdash;indeed, there was a sort of
conviction&mdash;on all hands that the city would be surrendered
on Saturday, July 4th, if, indeed, it could hold
out so long as that.</p>

<p>While apathy grew in our ranks, the Confederates
displayed more activity than ever. On the morning of
June 27th they sprang a countermine on Sherman's
front, which destroyed the mines Sherman's engineers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
had nearly finished, and threw the head of his sap into
general confusion. McPherson was prevented from
taking possession of the fort, which had been partially
destroyed. Ord's (lately McClernand's) working parties,
which were now well up to the Confederate lines,
were checked by hand grenades. Lauman was almost
nightly assailed by little sorties of the enemy, and
always lost a few men in them, killed, wounded, or
captured.</p>

<p>The operations west of the Mississippi became more
threatening, too. Our scouts brought in word that
Price and Kirby Smith were about to attempt to provision
Vicksburg by way of Milliken's Bend. There
were rumors also that some two thousand or more
skiffs had been prepared within the town, by which it
was thought the garrison might escape.</p>

<p>The general indisposition of our troops to prosecute
the siege zealously, and the evident determination on
the part of the enemy to hold out until the last, caused
General Grant to hold a council of war on the morning
of June 30th, to take judgment on the question of trying
another general assault, or leaving the result to the
exhaustion of the garrison. The conclusion of the
council was in favor of the latter policy, but two
days later, July 2d, Grant told me that if the enemy
did not give up Vicksburg by the 6th he should
storm it.</p>

<p>Happily, there was no need to wait until the 6th.
The general expectation that something would happen
by July 4th was about to be confirmed. On the morning
of Friday, July 3d, a soldier appeared on the Con<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>federate
line, in McPherson's front, bearing a flag of
truce. General A. J. Smith was sent to meet this man,
who proved to be an officer, General J. S. Bowen. He
bore a letter from Pemberton addressed to Grant. The
letter was taken to headquarters, where it was read by
the general and its contents were made known to the
staff. It was a request for an armistice to arrange terms
for the capitulation of Vicksburg. To this end Pemberton
asked that three commissioners be appointed to
meet a like number to be named by himself. Grant
immediately wrote this reply:</p>

<div class='letter'>

<p>The useless effusion of blood you propose stopping
by this course can be ended at any time you may choose
by an unconditional surrender of the city and garrison.
Men who have shown so much endurance and courage
as those now in Vicksburg will always challenge
the respect of an adversary, and I can assure you
will be treated with all the respect due to prisoners of
war.</p>

<p>I do not favor the proposition of appointing commissioners
to arrange terms of capitulation, because I
have no terms other than those indicated above.</p></div>

<p>Bowen, the bearer of Pemberton's letter, who had
been received by A. J. Smith, expressed a strong desire
to converse with General Grant. While declining this,
Grant requested Smith to say to Bowen that if General
Pemberton desired to see him an interview would
be granted between the lines in McPherson's front at
any hour in the afternoon which Pemberton might appoint.
After Bowen's departure a message was soon
sent back to Smith, accepting the proposal for an interview,
and appointing three o'clock as the hour.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
Grant was there with his staff and with Generals Ord,
McPherson, Logan, and A. J. Smith. Sherman was
not present, being with his command watching Joe
Johnston, and ready to spring upon the latter as soon
as Pemberton was captured. Pemberton came late,
attended by General Bowen and Colonel L. M. Montgomery.</p>

<p>It must have been a bitter moment for the Confederate
chieftain. Pemberton was a Northern man, a
Pennsylvanian by birth, from which State he was appointed
to West Point, graduating in 1837. In the old
army he fell under the spell of the influence of Jefferson
Davis, whose close friend he was. Davis appears to have
thought Pemberton was a military genius, for he was
jumped almost at a stroke, without much previous service,
to be a lieutenant general, and the defense of the
Mississippi River was given over to his charge. His
dispositions throughout the entire campaign, after Grant
crossed at Bruinsburg, were weak, and he was easily
overcome, although his troops fought well. As Joe
Johnston truthfully remarks in his Narrative, Pemberton
did not understand Grant's warfare at all. Penned
up and finally compelled to surrender a vital post and
a great army to his conqueror, an almost irremediable
disaster to his cause, Pemberton not only suffered the
usual pangs of defeat, but he was doubly humiliated by
the knowledge that he would be suspected and accused
of treachery by his adopted brethren, and that the result
would be used by the enemies of Davis, whose
favorite he was, to undermine the Confederate administration.
As the events proved, it was indeed a great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
blow to Davis's hold upon the people of the South.
These things must have passed through Pemberton's
mind as he faced Grant for this final settlement of the
fate of Vicksburg.</p>

<p>The conversation was held apart between Pemberton
and his two officers and Grant, McPherson, and A.
J. Smith, the rest of us being seated on the ground
near by.</p>

<p>We could, however, see that Pemberton was much
excited, and was impatient in his answers to Grant. He
insisted that his army be paroled and allowed to march
beyond our lines, officers and all, with eight days' rations,
drawn from their own stores, officers to retain
their private property and body servants. Grant heard
what Pemberton had to say, and left him at the end
of an hour and a half, saying that he would send in his
ultimatum in writing before evening; to this Pemberton
promised to reply before night, hostilities to cease
in the meantime. Grant then conferred at his headquarters
with his corps and division commanders, all
of whom, except Steele, who advised unconditional
surrender, favored a plan proposed by McPherson, and
finally adopted by Grant. The argument against the
plan was one of feeling only. In its favor it was urged
that it would at once not only tend to the demoralization
of the enemy, but also release Grant's whole
army for offensive operations against Joe Johnston and
Port Hudson, while to guard and transport so many
prisoners would require a great portion of our army's
strength. Keeping the prisoners would also absorb all
our steamboat transportation, while paroling them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
would leave it free to move our troops. Paroling would
also save us an enormous expenditure.</p>

<p>After long consideration, General Grant reluctantly
gave way to these reasons, and at six o'clock in the
afternoon he sent a letter by the hands of General Logan
and Lieutenant-Colonel Wilson, in which he stated as
terms that, as soon as rolls could be made out and paroles
signed by officers and men, Pemberton would be
allowed to march out of our lines, the officers taking with
them their side-arms and clothing, and the field, staff,
and cavalry officers one horse each. The rank and file
were to retain all their clothing, but no other property.
If these conditions were accepted, any amount of rations
deemed necessary was to be taken from the
stores they had, besides the necessary cooking utensils.
Thirty wagons also, counting two two-horse or mule
teams as one, were to be allowed to transport such articles
as could not be carried along. The same conditions
were allowed to all sick and wounded officers and soldiers
as fast as they became able to travel.</p>

<p>The officer who received this letter stated that it
would be impossible to answer it by night, and it was
not till a little before peep of day that the reply was
furnished. In the main the terms were accepted, but
Pemberton proposed as amendments:</p>

<div class='letter'>

<p>At 10 <small>A.M.</small> to-morrow I propose to evacuate the
works in and around Vicksburg, and to surrender the
city and garrison under my command by marching out
with my colors and arms, stacking them in front of my
present lines, after which you will take possession. Officers
to retain their side-arms and personal property,
and the rights and property of citizens to be respected.</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span></p>

<p>General Grant immediately replied:</p>

<div class='letter'>

<p>I can make no stipulations with regard to the treatment
of citizens and their private property.... The
property which officers will be allowed to take with
them will be as stated in my proposition of last evening....
If you mean by your proposition for each brigade
to march to the front of the line now occupied by it,
and stack arms at 10 <small>A.M.</small>, and then return to the inside
and there remain as prisoners until properly paroled,
I will make no objection to it.</p>

<p>Should no notification be received of your acceptance
of my terms by 9 <small>A.M.</small>, I shall regard them as having
been rejected, and shall act accordingly.</p></div>

<p>The answer came back promptly, "The terms proposed
by you are accepted."</p>

<p>We had a glorious celebration that day. Pemberton's
note had been received just after daylight, and at
the appointed hour of ten o'clock the surrender was
consummated, the Confederate troops marching out and
stacking arms in front of their works, while Pemberton
appeared for a moment with his staff upon the parapet
of the central fort. At eleven o'clock Grant entered
the city. He was received by Pemberton with more
marked impertinence than at their former interview.
Grant bore it like a philosopher, and in reply treated
Pemberton with even gentler courtesy and dignity than
before.</p>

<p>I rode into Vicksburg at the side of the conqueror,
and afterward perambulated among the conquered.
The Confederate soldiers were generally more contented
even than we were. Now they were going home,
they said. They had had enough of the war. The cause
of the Confederacy was lost. They wanted to take the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
oath of allegiance many of them. I was not surprised
to learn a month later that of the twenty-odd thousand
well men who were paroled at Vicksburg the greater
part had since dispersed, and I felt sure they could
never be got to serve again. The officers, on the other
hand, all declared their determination never to give in.
They had mostly on that day the look of men who have
been crying all night. One major, who commanded
a regiment from Missouri, burst into tears as he followed
his disarmed men back into their lines after they
had surrendered their colors and the guns in front of
them.</p>

<p>I found the buildings of Vicksburg much less damaged
than I had expected. Still, there were a good
many people living in caves dug in the banks. Naturally
the shells did less damage to these vaults than to
dwellings. There was a considerable supply of railroad
cars in the town, with one or two railroad locomotives
in working condition. There was also an unexpected
quantity of military supplies. At the end of the first
week after our entrance sixty-six thousand stand of
small arms had been collected, mainly in good condition,
and more were constantly being discovered. They
were concealed in caves, as well as in all sorts of buildings.
The siege and seacoast guns found exceeded
sixty, and the whole captured artillery was above two
hundred pieces. The stores of rebel ammunition also
proved to be surprisingly heavy. As Grant expressed
it, there was enough to have kept up the defense for
six years at the rate they were using it. The stock of
army clothing was officially invoiced at five million<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>
dollars&mdash;Confederate prices. Of sugar, molasses, and
salt there was a large quantity, and sixty thousand
pounds of bacon were found in one place.</p>

<p>The way in which Grant handled his army at the
capitulation of Vicksburg was a splendid example of
his energy. As soon as negotiations for surrender
began on the 3d, he sent word to Sherman, at his camp
on Bear Creek, to get ready to move against Johnston.
Sherman always acted on the instant, and that very
afternoon he threw bridges across the Big Black. He
started his forces over the river on the 4th as soon as
he received word that Pemberton had accepted Grant's
ultimatum.</p>

<p>In the meantime Grant had ordered part of Ord's
corps, all of Steele's division, and the two divisions of
the Ninth Corps, which was at Haynes's Bluff, to be
ready to join Sherman as soon as the capitulation
was effected. Their movement was so prompt that
by Sunday night, July 5th, part of Ord's force was
across the Big Black and Steele was well up to the
river.</p>

<p>As Grant supposed that Banks needed help at Port
Hudson, he had sent a messenger to him on the 1st of
the month telling him the surrender was imminent, and
offering aid if he needed it. A division&mdash;that of Herron&mdash;was
now made ready to march as soon as word came
back. In the city itself there was the greatest activity.
The occupation of the place by our forces was directed
by General McPherson, who was appointed to the command.
Three divisions were detailed to garrison the
line of fortifications and to furnish the guards for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
interior of the city. By the night of the 5th no troops
remained outside of Vicksburg.</p>

<p>The paroling of the Confederate troops began as
soon as the occupation was complete, and was pushed
with all possible rapidity. At the same time those parts
of the fortifications which we were now to defend were
selected, and the men began to obliterate the siege
approaches at which they had worked so hard and so
long. So busy was Grant with the mobilization of his
army for offensive field operations and the garrisoning
of Vicksburg that he did not take time even to write
to Washington. My telegram of July 5th to Mr. Stanton
describing the surrender and the condition of things
in Vicksburg conveyed this request from Grant for instructions
from Washington:</p>

<div class='letter'>

<p>General Grant, being himself intensely occupied, desires
me to say that he would like to receive from General
Halleck as soon as practicable either general or
specific instructions as to the future conduct of the
war in his department. He has no idea of going into
summer quarters, nor does he doubt his ability to employ
his army so as to make its blows tell toward the
great result; but he would like to be informed whether
the Government wishes him to follow his own judgment
or to co-operate in some particular scheme of
operations.</p></div>

<p class='p2'>With the fall of Vicksburg my mission was at an
end. On the 6th of July I left Grant for the North,
stopping at Helena, Ark., on my way up the river long
enough to get news of Gen. Prentiss's recent operations.
Thence I went on to Cairo and Washington.</p>

<p>I happened to be the first man to reach the capital
from Vicksburg, and everybody wanted to hear the
story and to ask questions. I was anxious to get home
and see my family, however, and left for New York as
soon as I could get away. A few days after I arrived
in New York I received an invitation to go into business
there with Mr. Ketchum, a banker, and with
George Opdyke, the merchant. I wrote Mr. Stanton
of the opening, but he urged me to remain in the War
Department as one of his assistants, which I consented
to do.<a name="FNanchor_C_3" id="FNanchor_C_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_C_3" class="fnanchor">[C]</a></p>

<p>The first commission with which Mr. Stanton
charged me after my appointment as his assistant was
one similar to that which I had just finished&mdash;to go to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>
Tennessee to observe and report the movements of
Rosecrans against Bragg. General Rosecrans, who,
after the battle of Stone's River, or Murfreesboro, on
December 31st to January 2, 1863, had lain for nearly
six months at Murfreesboro, obstructing on various
excuses all the efforts Lincoln and Stanton and Halleck
put forth to make him move against Bragg, who
occupied what was known as the Tullahoma line, had
toward the end of June moved on Bragg and driven
him across the Tennessee River. He had then settled
down to rest again, while Bragg had taken possession
of his new line in and about Chattanooga.</p>

<p>Burnside, who was in Kentucky, had been ordered
to unite with Rosecrans by way of East Tennessee, in
order that the combined force should attack Bragg,
but, despite the urgency of the administration, no movement
was made by Rosecrans until the middle of August.
As soon as it was evident that he was really
going out against the Confederates, Mr. Stanton asked
me to join the Army of the Cumberland. My orders
were to report directly to Rosecrans's headquarters. I
carried the following letter of introduction to that general:</p>

<div class='letter'>

which he merits, and explain to him fully any matters
which you may desire through him to bring to the notice
of the department.</p>

<p class='nr5right'>

</p></div>

<p>As soon as my papers arrived I left for my post. I
was much delayed on railroads and steamboats, and
when I reached Cincinnati found it was impossible to
join Burnside by his line of march to Knoxville and
from him go to Rosecrans, as I had intended. Accordingly
I went on to Louisville, where I arrived on September
5th. I found there that Burnside had just occupied
Knoxville; that the Ninth Corps, which two
months before I had left near Vicksburg, was now
about to go to him from near Louisville; and that Rosecrans
had queerly enough telegraphed to the clergy
all over the country that he expected a great battle that
day and desired their prayers.</p>

<p>I went directly from Louisville to Nashville, where
I found General Gordon Granger in command. As he
and Governor Johnson were going to the front in a
day or two, I waited to go with them. The morning
after my arrival at Nashville I went to call on Johnson.
I had never met him before.</p>

<p>Andrew Johnson was short and stocky, of dark
complexion, smooth face, dark hair, dark eyes, and
of great determination of appearance. When I went
to see him in his office, the first thing he said was:</p>

<p>"Will you have a drink?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I will," I answered. So he brought out a
jug of whisky and poured out as much as he wanted in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>
a tumbler, and then made it about half and half water.
The theoretical, philosophical drinker pours out a little
whisky and puts in almost no water at all&mdash;drinks it
pretty nearly pure&mdash;but when a man gets to taking a
good deal of water in his whisky, it shows he is in the
habit of drinking a good deal. I noticed that the Governor
took more whisky than most gentlemen would
have done, and I concluded that he took it pretty
often.</p>

<p>I had a prolonged conversation that morning with
Governor Johnson, who expressed himself in cheering
terms in regard to the general condition of Tennessee.
He regarded the occupation of Knoxville by Burnside
as completing the permanent expulsion of Confederate
power, and said he should order a general election for
the first week in October. He declared that slavery
was destroyed in fact, but must be abolished legally.
Johnson was thoroughly in favor of immediate emancipation
both as a matter of moral right and as an indispensable
condition of the large immigration of industrious
freemen which he thought necessary to repeople
and regenerate the State.</p>

<p>On the 10th of September we started for the front,
going by rail to Bridgeport, on the Tennessee River.
This town at that date was the terminus of the Nashville
and Chattanooga Railroad. The bridge across the
river and part of the railroad beyond had been destroyed
by Bragg when he retreated in the preceding summer
from Tullahoma. It was by way of Bridgeport that
troops were joining Rosecrans at the far front, and all
supplies went to him that way. On reaching the town,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>
we heard that Chattanooga had been occupied by Crittenden's
corps of Rosecrans's army the day before, September
9th; so the next day, September 11th, I pushed
on there by horseback past Shellmound and Wauhatchie.
The country through which I passed is a magnificent
region of rocks and valleys, and I don't believe
there is anywhere a finer view than that I had from
Lookout Mountain as I approached Chattanooga.</p>

<p>When I reached Chattanooga I went at once to
General Rosecrans's headquarters and presented my
letter. He read it, and then burst out in angry abuse
of the Government at Washington. He had not been
sustained, he said. His requests had been ignored, his
plans thwarted. Both Stanton and Halleck had done
all they could, he declared, to prevent his success.</p>

<p>"General Rosecrans," I said, "I have no authority
to listen to complaints against the Government. I was
sent here for the purpose of finding out what the Government
could do to aid you, and have no right to
confer with you on other matters."</p>

<p>He quieted down at once, and explained his situation
to me. He had reached Chattanooga, he said, on
the 10th, with Crittenden's troops, the Twenty-first
Corps, the town having been evacuated the day before
by the Confederates. As all the reports brought in
seemed to indicate that Bragg was in full retreat toward
Rome, Ga., Crittenden had immediately started in pursuit,
and had gone as far as Ringgold. On the night
before (September 11th) it had seemed evident that
Bragg had abandoned his retreat on Rome, and behind
the curtain of the woods and hills had returned with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>
purpose of suddenly falling with his whole army upon
the different corps and divisions of our army, now
widely separated by the necessity of crossing the mountains
at gaps far apart.</p>

<p>This was a serious matter for Rosecrans, if true, for
at that moment his army was scattered over a line more
than fifty miles long, extending from Chattanooga on
the north to Alpine on the south. Rosecrans pointed
out to me the positions on the map. Crittenden, he
explained, had been ordered immediately to leave Ringgold
and move westward to the valley of the West
Chickamauga. He was near a place known as Lee and
Gordon's Mills. General Thomas, who commanded the
Fourteenth Corps, had marched across Lookout Mountain
and now held Stevens's Gap, perhaps twenty-five
miles south of Chattanooga. McCook, with the Twentieth
Corps, had been ordered, after crossing the Tennessee,
to march southeast, and now was at Alpine,
fully thirty-five miles south of Crittenden. Orders had
been sent McCook, when it was found that Bragg had
made a stand, to rest his left flank on the southern base
of Mission Ridge, and, extending his line toward Summerville,
fall on the flank of the enemy should he follow
the valley that way. The reserve, under Gordon
Granger, was still north of the Tennessee, although one
division had reached Bridgeport and the rest were rapidly
approaching. Notwithstanding the signs that
Bragg might not be retreating so fast as he at first appeared
to have been, Rosecrans was confident as late
as the 12th that the Confederate commander was merely
making a show of the offensive to check pursuit, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
that he would make his escape to Rome as soon as he
found our army concentrated for battle east of Lookout
Mountain.</p>

<p>The next day (the 13th) I left Chattanooga with
Rosecrans and his staff for Thomas's headquarters at
Stevens's Gap. We found everything progressing favorably
there. The movements for the concentration
of the three corps were going forward with energy.
Scouts were coming in constantly, who reported that
the enemy had withdrawn from the basin where our
army was assembling; that he was evacuating Lafayette
and moving toward Rome. It seemed as if at last the
Army of the Cumberland had practically gained a position
from which it could effectually advance upon Rome
and Atlanta, and deliver there the finishing blow of
the war. The difficulties of gaining this position, of
crossing the Cumberland Mountains, passing the Tennessee,
turning and occupying Chattanooga, traversing
the mountain ridges of northern Georgia, and seizing
the passes which led southward had been enormous. It
was only when I came personally to examine the region
that I appreciated what had been done. These difficulties
were all substantially overcome. The army was
in the best possible condition, and was advancing with
all the rapidity which the nature of the country allowed.
Our left flank toward East Tennessee was secured by
Burnside, and the only disadvantage which I could see
was that a sudden movement of the enemy to our right
might endanger our long and precarious line of communications
and compel us to retreat again beyond the
Tennessee. I felt this so keenly that I urged Mr. Stan<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>ton,
in a dispatch sent to him on the 14th from Thomas's
headquarters, to push as strong a column as possible
eastward from Corinth, in northeastern Mississippi. It
seemed to me that it would be better to recall the troops
from the West rather than to risk a check here, where
the heart of rebellion was within reach and the final
blow all prepared.</p>

<p>But, after all, there was something of a mystery
about the real location of Bragg's army, its strength,
and the designs of its chief. At any rate it was soon
manifest that Bragg was not withdrawing to the southward,
as at first supposed. Some queer developments
down the Chickamauga on the 16th and 17th caused
Rosecrans considerable anxiety for Chattanooga. The
impression began to grow, too, that Bragg had been
playing 'possum, and had not retreated at all. Rosecrans
at once abandoned all idea of operations against
the Confederate line of retreat and supply, drew his
army in rapidly, and began to look sharply after his own
communications with Chattanooga, which had now become
his base.</p>

<p>By noon of September 18th the concentration was
practically complete. Our army then lay up and down
the valley, with West Chickamauga Creek in front of
the greater part of the line. The left was held by Crittenden,
the center by Thomas, and the right by McCook,
whose troops were now all in the valley except
one brigade. The army had not concentrated any too
soon, for that very afternoon the enemy appeared on
our left, and a considerable engagement occurred. It
was said at headquarters that a battle was certain the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
next day. The only point Rosecrans had not determined
at five o'clock on the afternoon of the 18th was
whether to make a night march and fall on Bragg at
daylight or to await his onset.</p>

<p>But that night it became pretty clear to all that
Bragg's plan was to push by our left into Chattanooga.
This compelled another rapid movement by the left
down the Chickamauga. By a tiresome night march
Thomas moved down behind Crittenden and below Lee
and Gordon's Mills, taking position on our extreme
left. Crittenden followed, connecting with Thomas's
right, and thus taking position in the center. McCook's
corps also extended down stream to the left, but still
covered the creek as high up as Crawfish Spring, while
part of his troops acted as a reserve. These movements
were hurriedly made, and the troops, especially those of
Thomas, were very much exhausted by their efforts
to get into position.</p>

<p>Rosecrans had not been mistaken in Bragg's intention.
About nine o'clock the next morning at Crawfish
Spring, where the general headquarters were, we
heard firing on our left, and reports at once came in
that the battle had begun there, Bragg being in command
of the enemy. Thomas had barely headed the
Confederates off from Chattanooga. We remained at
Crawfish Springs on this day until after one o'clock,
waiting for the full proportions of the conflict to develop.
When it became evident that the battle was
being fought entirely on our left, Rosecrans removed
his headquarters nearer to the scene, taking a little
house near Lee and Gordon's Mills, known as the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>
Widow Glenn's. Although closer to the battle, we
could see no more of it here than at Crawfish Springs,
the conflict being fought altogether in a thick forest,
and being invisible to outsiders. The nature of the
firing and the reports from the commanders alone enabled
us to follow its progress.</p>

<p>That we were able to keep as well informed as we
were was due to our excellent telegraphic communications.
By this time the military telegraph had been so
thoroughly developed that it was one of the most useful
accessories of our army, even on a battlefield. For
instance, after Rosecrans had taken Crawfish Springs
as his headquarters, he had given orders, on September
17th, to connect the place with Chattanooga, thirteen
miles to the northwest. The line was completed after
the battle began on the 19th, and we were in communication
not only with Chattanooga, but with Granger at
Rossville and with Thomas at his headquarters. When
Rosecrans removed to the Widow Glenn's, the telegraphers
went along, and in an hour had connections made
and an instrument clicking away in Mrs. Glenn's house.
We thus had constant information of the way the battle
was going, not only from the orderlies, but also from the
wires.</p>

<p>This excellent arrangement enabled me also to keep
the Government at Washington informed of the progress
of the battle. I sent eleven dispatches that day to
Mr. Stanton. They were very brief, but they reported
all that I, near as I was to the scene, knew of the battle
of September 19th at Chickamauga.</p>

<p>It was not till after dark that firing ceased and final<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>
reports began to come in. From these we found that
the enemy had been defeated in his attempt to turn
and crush our left flank and secure possession of the
Chattanooga roads, but that he was not wholly defeated,
for he still held his ground in several places, and
was preparing, it was believed, to renew the battle the
next day.</p>

<p>That evening Rosecrans decided that if Bragg did
not retreat he would renew the fight at daylight, and a
council of war was held at our headquarters at the
Widow Glenn's, to which all the corps and division
commanders were summoned. There must have been
ten or twelve general officers there. Rosecrans began
by asking each of the corps commanders for a report
of the condition of his troops and of the position they
occupied; also for his opinion of what was to be done.
Each proposition was discussed by the entire council as
it was made. General Thomas was so tired&mdash;he had not
slept at all the night before, and he had been in battle
all day&mdash;that he went to sleep every minute. Every
time Rosecrans spoke to him he would straighten up
and answer, but he always said the same thing, "I would
strengthen the left," and then he would be asleep, sitting
up in his chair. General Rosecrans, to the proposition
to strengthen the left, made always the same reply,
"Where are we going to take it from?"</p>

<p>After the discussion was ended, Rosecrans gave his
orders for the disposition of the troops on the following
day. Thomas's corps was to remain on the left
with his line somewhat drawn in, but substantially as
he was at the close of the day. McCook was to close<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>
on Thomas and cover the position at Widow Glenn's,
and Crittenden was to have two divisions in reserve
near the junction of McCook's and Thomas's lines, to
be able to succor either. These orders were written for
each corps commander. They were also read in the
presence of all, and the plans fully explained. Finally,
after everything had been said, hot coffee was brought
in, and then McCook was called upon to sing the Hebrew
Maiden. McCook sang the song, and then the
council broke up and the generals went away.</p>

<p>This was about midnight, and, as I was very tired,
I lay down on the floor to sleep, beside Captain Horace
Porter, who was at that time Rosecrans's chief of ordnance.
There were cracks in the floor of the Widow
Glenn's house, and the wind blew up under us. We
would go to sleep, and then the wind would come up
so cold through the cracks that it would wake us up,
and we would turn over together to keep warm.</p>

<p>At daybreak we at headquarters were all up and on
our horses ready to go with the commanding general
to inspect our lines. We rode past McCook, Crittenden,
and Thomas to the extreme left, Rosecrans giving as
he went the orders he thought necessary to strengthen
the several positions. The general intention of these
orders was to close up on the left, where it was evident
the attack would begin. We then rode back to the extreme
right, Rosecrans stopping at each point to see
if his orders had been obeyed. In several cases they
had not been obeyed, and he made them more peremptory.
When we found that McCook's line had
been elongated so that it was a mere thread, Rosecrans<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>
was very angry, and sent for the general, rebuking him
severely, although, as a matter of fact, General McCook's
position had been taken under the written orders
of the commander in chief, given the night before.</p>

<p>About half past eight or nine o'clock the battle
began on the left, where Thomas was. At that time
Rosecrans, with whom I always remained, was on the
right, directing the movements of the troops there. Just
after the cannon began I remember that a ten-pound
shell came crashing through our staff, but hurting nobody.
I had not slept much for two nights, and, as it
was warm, I dismounted about noon and, giving my
horse to my orderly, lay down on the grass and went to
sleep. I was awakened by the most infernal noise I ever
heard. Never in any battle I had witnessed was there
such a discharge of cannon and musketry. I sat up on
the grass, and the first thing I saw was General Rosecrans
crossing himself&mdash;he was a very devout Catholic.
"Hello!" I said to myself, "if the general is crossing
himself, we are in a desperate situation."</p>

<p>I was on my horse in a moment. I had no sooner
collected my thoughts and looked around toward the
front, where all this din came from, than I saw our lines
break and melt away like leaves before the wind. Then
the headquarters around me disappeared. The gray-backs
came through with a rush, and soon the musket
balls and the cannon shot began to reach the place where
we stood. The whole right of the army had apparently
been routed. My orderly stuck to me like a veteran,
and we drew back for greater safety into the woods a
little way. There I came upon General Porter&mdash;Captain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
Porter he was then&mdash;and Captain Drouillard, an aide-de-camp
infantry officer attached to General Rosecrans's
staff, halting fugitives. They would halt a few
of them, get them into some sort of a line, and make a
beginning of order among them, and then there would
come a few rounds of cannon shot through the tree-tops
over their heads and the men would break and run. I
saw Porter and Drouillard plant themselves in front of
a body of these stampeding men and command them to
halt. One man charged with his bayonet, menacing
Porter; but Porter held his ground, and the man gave
in. That was the only case of real mutiny that I ever
saw in the army, and that was under such circumstances
that the man was excusable. The cause of all this disaster
was the charge of the Confederates through the
hiatus in the line caused by the withdrawal of Wood's
division, under a misapprehension of orders, before its
place could be filled.</p>

<p>I attempted to make my way from this point in the
woods to Sheridan's division, but when I reached the
place where I knew it had been a little time before,
I found it had been swept from the field. Not far
away, however, I stumbled on a body of organized
troops. This was a brigade of mounted riflemen under
Colonel John T. Wilder, of Indiana. "Mr. Dana,"
asked Colonel Wilder, "what is the situation?"</p>

<p>"I do not know," I said, "except that this end of
the army has been routed. There is still heavy fighting
at the left front, and our troops seem to be holding
their ground there yet."</p>

<p>"Will you give me any orders?" he asked.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span></p>

<p>"I have no authority to give orders," I replied;
"but if I were in your situation I should go to the left,
where Thomas is."</p>

<p>Then I turned my horse, and, making my way over
Missionary Ridge, struck the Chattanooga Valley and
rode to Chattanooga, twelve or fifteen miles away. The
whole road was filled with flying soldiers; here and there
were pieces of artillery, caissons, and baggage wagons.
Everything was in the greatest disorder. When I
reached Chattanooga, a little before four o'clock, I
found Rosecrans there. In the helter-skelter to the
rear he had escaped by the Rossville road. He was expecting
every moment that the enemy would arrive
before the town, and was doing all he could to prepare
to resist his entrance. Soon after I arrived the two
corps commanders, McCook and Crittenden, both came
into Chattanooga.</p>

<p>The first thing I did on reaching town was to telegraph
Mr. Stanton. I had not sent him any telegrams
in the morning, for I had been in the field with Rosecrans,
and part of the time at some distance from the
Widow Glenn's, where the operators were at work. The
boys kept at their post there until the Confederates swept
them out of the house. When they had to run, they
went instruments and tools in hand, and as soon as out
of reach of the enemy set up shop on a stump. It was
not long before they were driven out of this. They
next attempted to establish an office on the Rossville
road, but before they had succeeded in making connections
a battle was raging around them, and they had to
retreat to Granger's headquarters at Rossville.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span></p>

<p>Having been swept bodily off the battlefield, and
having made my way into Chattanooga through a panic-stricken
rabble, the first telegram which I sent to Mr.
Stanton was naturally colored by what I had seen and
experienced. I remember that I began the dispatch
by saying: "My report to-day is of deplorable importance.
Chickamauga is as fatal a name in our history
as Bull Run." By eight o'clock that evening, however,
I found that I had given too dark a view of the
disaster.</p>

<p class='p2'>Early the next morning things looked still better.
Rosecrans received a telegram from Thomas at Rossville,
to which point he had withdrawn after the nightfall,
saying that his troops were in high spirits, and that
he had brought off all his wounded. A little while
before noon General James A. Garfield, who was chief
of Rosecrans's staff, arrived in Chattanooga and gave
us the first connected account we had of the battle on
the left after the rout. Garfield said that he had become
separated from Rosecrans in the rout of our right wing
and had made his way to the left, and spent the afternoon
and night with General Thomas. There he witnessed
the sequel of the battle in that part of the field.
Thomas, finding himself cut off from Rosecrans and
the right, at once marshalled the remaining divisions for
independent fighting. Refusing both his right and left,
his line assumed the form of a horseshoe, posted along
the slope and crest of a partly wooded ridge. He was
soon joined by Granger from Rossville, with Steedman
and most of the reserve; and with these forces, more
than two thirds of the army, he firmly maintained the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>
fight till after dark. Our troops were as immovable
as the rocks they stood on. Longstreet hurled against
them repeatedly the dense columns which had routed
Davis and Sheridan in the early afternoon, but every
onset was repulsed with dreadful slaughter. Falling
first on one and then another point of our lines, for
hours the rebels vainly sought to break them. Thomas
seemed to have filled every soldier with his own unconquerable
firmness, and Granger, his hat torn by bullets,
raged like a lion wherever the combat was hottest with
the electrical courage of a Ney. When night fell, this
body of heroes stood on the same ground they had occupied
in the morning, their spirit unbroken, but their
numbers greatly diminished.</p>

<h3>THE REMOVAL OF ROSECRANS.</h3>

successor&mdash;Portrait of Thomas&mdash;The dignity and loyalty

<p>All the news we could get the next day of the enemy's
movements seemed to show that the Confederate
forces were concentrating on Chattanooga. Accordingly,
Rosecrans gave orders for all our troops to gather
in the town at once and prepare for the attack which
would probably take place within a day or two. By
midnight the army was in Chattanooga. The troops
were in wonderful spirits, considering their excessive
fatigues and heavy losses, and the next morning went
to work with energy on the fortifications. All the morning
of the 22d the enemy were approaching, resisted
by our advance parties, and by the middle of the afternoon
the artillery firing was so near that it seemed certain
that the battle would be fought before dark. No
attack was made that day, however, nor the next, and
by the morning of the 24th the Herculean labors of the
army had so fortified the place that it was certain that
it could be taken only by a regular siege or by a turn<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>ing
movement. The strength of our forces was about
forty-five thousand effective men, and we had ten days'
full rations on hand. Chattanooga could hold out, but
it was apparent that no offensive operations were possible
until re-enforcements came. These we knew had
been hurried toward us as soon as the news of the disaster
of the 20th reached Washington. Burnside was
coming from Knoxville, we supposed, Hooker had
been ordered from Washington by rail, Sherman from
Vicksburg by steamer, and some of Hurlbut's troops
from Memphis.</p>

<p>The enemy by the 24th were massed in Chattanooga
Valley, and held Missionary Ridge and Lookout Mountain.
The summit of Lookout Mountain, almost the
key to Chattanooga, was not given up by Rosecrans
until the morning of the 24th; then he ordered the
withdrawal of the brigade which held the heights, and
the destruction of the wagon road which winds along
its side at about one third of its height and connects the
valleys of Chattanooga and Lookout. Both Granger
and Garfield earnestly protested against this order, contending
that the mountain and the road could be held
by not more than seven regiments against the whole
power of the enemy. They were obviously right, but
Rosecrans was sometimes as obstinate and inaccessible
to reason as at others he was irresolute, vacillating, and
inconclusive, and he pettishly rejected all their arguments.
The mountain was given up.</p>

<p>As soon as we felt reasonably sure that Chattanooga
could hold out until re-enforcements came, the
disaster of the 20th of September became the absorb<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>ing
topic of conversation in the Army of the Cumberland.
At headquarters, in camp, in the street, on the
fortifications, officers and soldiers and citizens wrangled
over the reasons for the loss of the day. By the end
of the first week after the disaster a serious fermentation
reigned in the Twentieth and Twenty-first Army
Corps, and, indeed, throughout the whole army, growing
out of events connected with the battle.</p>

<p>There was at once a manifest disposition to hold
McCook and Crittenden, the commanders of the two
corps, responsible, because they had left the field of
battle amid the rout of the right wing and made their
way to Chattanooga.<a name="FNanchor_D_4" id="FNanchor_D_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_D_4" class="fnanchor">[D]</a> It was not generally understood
or appreciated at that time that, because of Thomas's
repeated calls for aid and Rosecrans's consequent alarm
for his left, Crittenden had been stripped of all his troops
and had no infantry whatever left to command, and that
McCook's lines also had been reduced to a fragment
by similar orders from Rosecrans and by fighting. A
strong opposition to both sprang up, which my telegrams
to Mr. Stanton immediately after the battle fully
reflect. The generals of division and of brigade felt the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>
situation deeply, and said that they could no longer
serve under such superiors, and that, if this was required
of them, they must resign. This feeling was
universal among them, including men like Major-Generals
Palmer and Sheridan and Brigadier-Generals
Wood, Johnson, and Hazen.</p>

<p>The feeling of these officers did not seem in the least
to partake of a mutinous or disorderly character; it was
rather conscientious unwillingness to risk their men and
the country's cause in hands which they thought to be
unsafe. No formal representation of this unwillingness
was made to Rosecrans, but he was made aware of the
state of things by private conversations with several of
the parties. The defects of his character complicated
the difficulty. He abounded in friendliness and approbativeness,
and was greatly lacking in firmness and
steadiness of will. In short, he was a temporizing man;
he dreaded so heavy an alternative as was now presented,
and hated to break with McCook and Crittenden.</p>

<p>Besides, there was a more serious obstacle to Rosecrans's
acting decisively in the fact that if Crittenden
and McCook had gone to Chattanooga, with the sound
of artillery in their ears, from that glorious field where
Thomas and Granger were saving their army and their
country's honor, he had gone to Chattanooga also. It
might be said in his excuse that, under the circumstances
of the sudden rout, it was perfectly proper for the commanding
general to go to the rear to prepare the next
line of defense. Still, Rosecrans felt that that excuse
could not entirely clear him either in his own eyes or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>
in those of the army. In fact, it was perfectly plain
that, while the subordinate commanders would not
resign if he was retained in the chief command, as I
believe they certainly would have done if McCook and
Crittenden had not been relieved, their respect for
Rosecrans as a general had received an irreparable
blow.</p>

<p>The dissatisfaction with Rosecrans seemed to me to
put the army into a very dangerous condition, and, in
writing to Mr. Stanton on September 27th, I said that
if it was decided to change the chief commander I would
suggest that some Western commander of high rank
and great prestige, like Grant, would be preferable as
Rosecrans's successor to one who had hitherto commanded
in the East alone.</p>

<p>The army, however, had its own candidate for Rosecrans's
post. General Thomas had risen to the highest
point in their esteem, as he had in that of every one
who witnessed his conduct on that unfortunate and
glorious day, and I saw that, should there be a change
in the chief command, there was no other man whose
appointment would be so welcome. I earnestly recommended
Mr. Stanton that in event of a change in the
chief command Thomas's merits be considered. He
was certainly an officer of the very highest qualities,
soldierly and personally. He was a man of the greatest
dignity of character. He had more the character of
George Washington than any other man I ever knew.
At the same time he was a delightful man to be with;
there was no artificial dignity about Thomas. He was
a West Point graduate, and very well educated. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>
was very set in his opinions, yet he was not impatient
with anybody&mdash;a noble character.</p>

<p>In reply to my recommendation of Thomas, I received
a telegram from the Secretary of War, saying:
"I wish you to go directly to see General Thomas, and
say to him that his services, his abilities, his character,
his unselfishness, have always been most cordially appreciated
by me, and that it is not my fault that he has not
long since had command of an independent army."</p>

<p>Accordingly, I went at once over to General Thomas's
headquarters. I remember that I got there just
after they had finished dinner; the table was not cleared
off, but there was nobody in the dining room. When
General Thomas came in, I read to him the telegram
from the Secretary. He was too much affected by it
to reply immediately. After a moment he said:</p>

<p>"Mr. Dana, I wish you would say to the Secretary
of War that I am greatly affected by this expression
of his confidence; that I should have long since liked
to have had an independent command, but what I
should have desired would have been the command of
an army that I could myself have organized, disciplined,
distributed, and combined. I wish you would add also
that I would not like to take the command of an army
where I should be exposed to the imputation of having
intrigued or of having exercised any effort to supplant
my previous commander."</p>

<p>This was on October 4th. Four days later General
Thomas sent a confidential friend to me, saying rumors
had come to him that he was to be put in Rosecrans's
place; that, while he would gladly accept any other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>
command to which Mr. Stanton should see fit to assign
him, he could not consent to become the successor of
General Rosecrans. He would not do anything to give
countenance to the suspicion that he had intrigued
against his commander's interest. He declared that he
had perfect confidence in the fidelity and capacity of
General Rosecrans.</p>

<p>The first change in the Army of the Cumberland was
an order from Washington consolidating the Twentieth
and Twenty-first Corps. The news reached Chattanooga
on October 5th in a Nashville newspaper, and,
not having been previously promulgated, it caused a
sensation. Crittenden was much excited, and said that,
as the Government no longer required his services, he
would resign; at any rate, he would not hibernate like
others, drawing pay and doing no work. McCook took
it easily. The consolidation of the two corps was generally
well received, and, as it was to be followed by a
general reorganization of the army, it seemed as if the
most happy consequences would be produced. The
only serious difficulty which followed the change was
that the men in the consolidated corps were troubled
by letters from home, showing that their friends regarded
a consolidation as a token of disgrace and punishment.</p>

<p>Although the reorganization of the army was going
on, there was no real change in our situation, and by
the middle of October it began to look as if we were
in a helpless and precarious position. No re-enforcements
had yet reached us, the enemy was growing
stronger every day, and, worse still, we were threatened<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>
with starvation. Rosecrans's error in abandoning Lookout
Mountain to the enemy on September 24th was
now apparent. Our supplies came by rail from Nashville
to Bridgeport; but the enemy controlled the south
shore of the Tennessee between us and Bridgeport, and
thus prevented our rebuilding the railroad from Bridgeport
to Chattanooga; with their shore batteries they
stopped the use of our steamboats. They even made
the road on the north shore impassable, the sharpshooters
on the south bank being able to pick off our
men on the north. The forage and supplies which we
had drawn from the country within our reach were now
exhausted, and we were dependent upon what could
be got to us over the roads north of the river. These
were not only disturbed by the enemy, but were so bad
in places that the mud was up to the horses' bellies.
The animals themselves had become too weak to haul
the empty train up the mountain, while many had died
of starvation. On October 15th the troops were on half
rations, and officers as they went about where the men
were working on the fortifications frequently heard the
cry of "Crackers!"</p>

<p>In the midst of these difficulties General Rosecrans
seemed to be insensible to the impending danger; he
dawdled with trifles in a manner which scarcely can be
imagined. With plenty of zealous and energetic officers
ready to do whatever needed to be done, precious
time was lost because our dazed and mazy commander
could not perceive the catastrophe that was close upon
us, nor fix his mind upon the means of preventing it.
I never saw anything which seemed so lamentable and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>
hopeless. Our animals were starving, the men had
starvation before them, and the enemy was bound soon
to make desperate efforts to dislodge us. Yet the commanding
general devoted that part of the time which
was not employed in pleasant gossip to the composition
of a long report to prove that the Government was to
blame for his failure on the 20th.</p>

<p>While few persons exhibited more estimable social
qualities, I have never seen a public man possessing
talent with less administrative power, less clearness and
steadiness in difficulty, and greater practical incapacity
than General Rosecrans. He had inventive fertility and
knowledge, but he had no strength of will and no concentration
of purpose. His mind scattered; there was
no system in the use of his busy days and restless nights,
no courage against individuals in his composition, and,
with great love of command, he was a feeble commander.
He was conscientious and honest, just as he was imperious
and disputatious; always with a stray vein of
caprice and an overweening passion for the approbation
of his personal friends and the public outside.</p>

<p>Although the army had been reorganized as a result
of the consolidation of the Twentieth and Twenty-first
Corps, it was still inefficient and its discipline defective.
The former condition proceeded from the fact that General
Rosecrans insisted on directing personally every
department, and kept every one waiting and uncertain
till he himself could directly supervise every operation.
The latter proceeded from his utter lack of firmness, his
passion for universal applause, and his incapacity to
hurt any man's feelings by just severity.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span></p>

<p>My opinion of Rosecrans and my fears that the army
would soon be driven from Chattanooga by starvation,
if not by the Confederates, I had reiterated in my letters
to Mr. Stanton. On the morning of October 19th I
received a dispatch from Mr. Stanton, sent from Washington
on October 16th, asking me to meet him that
day at the Gait House in Louisville. I wired him that,
unless he ordered to the contrary, Rosecrans would retreat
at once from Chattanooga, and then I started for
Louisville. It was a hard trip by horseback over
Walden's Ridge and through Jasper to Bridgeport, and
the roads were not altogether safe. Ten days before
this, in riding along the edge of a bank near the river
shore, the earth had given way under my horse's hind
feet, and he and I had been tumbled together down a
bank, about fourteen feet high; we rolled over each
other in the sand at the bottom. I got off with no worse
injury than a bruise of my left shoulder and a slight
crack on the back of my head from the horse's hind
foot, which made the blood run a little. The roads
over Walden Ridge and along the river were even worse
now than when I got my tumble, and, besides, they
were filled with wagons trying to get supplies to Chattanooga.
It took at that time ten days for wagon teams
to go from Stevenson, where we had a depot, to Chattanooga.
Though subsistence stores were so nearly exhausted,
the wagons were compelled to throw overboard
portions of their precious cargo in order to get
through. The returning trains were blockaded. On the
17th of October five hundred teams were halted between
the mountain and the river without forage for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>
the animals, and unable to move in any direction; the
whole road was strewn with dead animals.</p>

<p>The railway from Bridgeport to Nashville was not
much more comfortable or safer than the road. Early
in the month I had gone to Nashville on business, and
had come back in a tremendous storm in a train of
eighteen cars crowded with soldiers, and was twenty-six
hours on the road instead of ten. On the present
trip, however, I got along very well until within about
eight miles from Nashville, when our train narrowly
escaped destruction. A tie had been inserted in a
cattle guard to throw the train down an embankment,
but it had been calculated for a train going south, so
that ours simply broke it off. From what we learned
afterward, we thought it was intended for a train on
which it was supposed General Grant was going to
Bridgeport.</p>

<p>My train was bound through to Louisville. Indeed,
I think there was no one with me except the train hands
and the engineer. We reached Nashville about ten
o'clock on the night of October 20th, and there were
halted. Directly there came in an officer&mdash;I think it
was Lieutenant-Colonel Bowers, of General Grant's staff&mdash;who
said:</p>

<p>"General Grant wants to see you."</p>

<p>This was the first that I knew Grant was in Tennessee.
I got out of my train and went over to his. I
hadn't seen him since we parted at Vicksburg.</p>

<p>"I am going to interfere with your journey, Mr.
Dana," he said as soon as I came in. "I have got the
Secretary's permission to take you back with me to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>
Chattanooga. I want you to dismiss your train and
get in mine; we will give you comfortable quarters."</p>

<p>"General," I said, "did you ask the Secretary to
let me go back with you?"</p>

<p>"I did," he said; "I wanted to have you."</p>

<p class='p2'>So, of course, I went. On the way down he told
me that he had been appointed to the command of the
"Military Division of the Mississippi," with permission
to leave Rosecrans in command of the Department of
the Cumberland or to assign Thomas in his place. He
had done the latter, he said, and had telegraphed
Thomas to take charge of the army the night after Stanton,
at Louisville, had received my dispatch of the 19th
saying Rosecrans would retreat from Chattanooga unless
ordered to remain. Rosecrans was assigned to the
Department of the Missouri, with headquarters at St.
Louis.</p>

<p>With Grant I left Nashville for the front on the
morning of the 21st. We arrived safe in Bridgeport in
the evening. The next morning, October 22d, we left
on horseback for Chattanooga by way of Jasper and
Walden's Ridge. The roads were in such a condition
that it was impossible for Grant, who was on crutches
from an injury to his leg received by the fall of a horse
in New Orleans some time before, to make the whole
distance of fifty-five miles in one day, so I pushed on
ahead, running the rebel picket lines, and reaching
Chattanooga in the evening in company with Colonel
Wilson, Grant's inspector general.</p>

<p>The next morning I went to see General Thomas; it
was not an official visit, but a friendly one, such a visit
as I very often made on the generals. When we had
shaken hands, he said:</p>

<p>"Mr. Dana, you have got me this time; but there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>
is nothing for a man to do in such a case as this but to
obey orders."</p>

<p>This was in allusion to his assignment to the command
of the Army of the Cumberland. The change in
command was received with satisfaction by all intelligent
officers, so far as I could ascertain, though, of
course, Rosecrans had many friends who were unable
to conceive why he was relieved. They reported that
he was to be put in command of the Army of the Potomac.
The change at headquarters was already strikingly
perceptible, order prevailing instead of universal
chaos.</p>

<p>On the evening of the 23d Grant arrived, as I stated
in my dispatch to Mr. Stanton, "wet, dirty, and well."
The next morning he was out with Thomas and Smith
to reconnoiter a position which the latter general had
discovered at the mouth of Lookout Valley, which he
believed, if it could be taken possession of and at the
same time if Raccoon Mountain could be occupied,
would give us Lookout Valley, and so enable us again
to bring supplies up the river. In preparation for this
movement, Smith had been getting bridges ready to
throw across the river at the mouth of the valley, and
been fitting up a steamer to use for supplies when we
should control the river.</p>

<p>The Confederates at that time were massed in Chattanooga
Valley, south of Chattanooga. They held Missionary
Ridge to the east, and Lookout Mountain to
the west. They had troops in Lookout Valley also, and
their pickets extended westward over Raccoon Mountain
to the river. South of the river, at Brown's Ferry,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>
were several low mamelons. Smith's idea was to surprise
the Confederate pickets here at night and seize
the position in time to unite with Hooker, who in the
meantime should be ordered up from Bridgeport by
way of Shellmound, Whiteside, and Wauhatchie. That
night Grant gave orders for the movement; in fact, he
began it by sending Palmer's division across Walden's
Ridge to Rankin's Ferry, where he was to cross and
occupy Shellmound, thus guarding Hooker's rear.
Hooker he ordered to march from Bridgeport on the
morning of the 26th.</p>

<p>I went to Bridgeport on the 25th to observe Hooker's
movement, but found he was not there, and would
not be ready to march the next morning as ordered.
Hooker came up from Stevenson to Bridgeport on the
evening of the 26th. He was in an unfortunate state of
mind for one who had to co-operate&mdash;fault-finding and
criticising. No doubt it was true that the chaos of the
Rosecrans administration was as bad as he described
it to be, but he was quite as truculent toward the plan
that he was now to execute as toward the impotence and
confusion of the old <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">r√©gime</i>. By the next morning he
was ready to start, and the troops moved out for Shellmound
about half past six. By half past four in the
afternoon we arrived at Whiteside Valley; thence the
march was directly to Wauhatchie. Here there was an
insignificant skirmish, which did not stop us long. By
the afternoon of the 28th we were at the mouth of the
Lookout Valley, where we found that General Smith,
by an operation whose brilliancy can not be exaggerated,
had taken the mamelons south of the river.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>
The only serious opposition to our occupancy of the
position came that night, but the enemy was successfully
repulsed.</p>

<p>Our forces now held Lookout Valley and controlled
the river from Brown's Ferry to Bridgeport. The next
day supplies were started up the river. At first they
came no farther than Kelley's Ferry, which was about
ten miles from Chattanooga. This was because the
steamer at Bridgeport could not get through the Suck,
an ugly pass in the mountains through which the river
runs; but on the night of the 30th we succeeded in
getting our steamer at Chattanooga past the pickets
on Lookout Mountain and down to Brown's Ferry.
She could pass the Suck, and after that supplies came
by water to Brown's Ferry.</p>

<p>Within a week after Grant's arrival we were receiving
supplies daily. There was no further danger of the
Army of the Cumberland being starved out of Chattanooga.
The Confederates themselves at once recognized
this, for a copy of the Atlanta Appeal of November
3d which reached me said that if we were not
dislodged from Lookout Valley our possession of Chattanooga
was secure for the winter.</p>

<p>It was now certain that we could hold Chattanooga;
but until Sherman reached us we could do nothing
against the enemy and nothing to relieve Burnside, who
had been ordered to unite with Rosecrans in August,
but had never got beyond Knoxville. He was shut up
there much in the same way as we were in Chattanooga,
and it was certain that the Confederates were sending
forces against him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span></p>

<p>The day after Grant arrived we had good evidence
that the Confederates were moving in large force to
the northeastward of Chattanooga, for heavy railroad
trains went out in that direction and light ones returned.
Deserters to us on the morning of the 25th reported
that a large force was at Charleston, Tenn., and that
fully five thousand mounted infantry had crossed the
Tennessee River above Washington. That night it was
noticed that the pickets on Lookout Mountain, and
even down into the valley on the Chattanooga side,
were much diminished. We judged from this that the
enemy had withdrawn both from the top of the mountain
and from the valley. There were other rumors of
their movements toward Burnside during the next few
days, and on November 6th some definite information
came through a deserter, a Northern man who had
lived in Georgia before the war and had been forced
into the service. He reported that two divisions had
moved up the Tennessee some time ago, and confirmed
our suspicion that the troops had been withdrawn
from Lookout Mountain. He said it was well understood
among the Confederates that these forces
were going by way of Loudon to join those which
had already gone up the river, to co-operate with a
force of Lee's army in driving Burnside out of East
Tennessee.</p>

<p>Grant's first move to meet this plan of the enemy
was to direct Sherman, who had been trying to rebuild
and hold the railroad from Memphis as he marched
forward, to abandon this work and hasten up to Stevenson.
Grant then considered what movement could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>
be made which would compel the enemy to recall the
troops sent against Burnside.</p>

<p>Grant was so anxious to know the real condition of
Burnside that he asked me to go to Knoxville and
find out. So on November 9th I started, accompanied
by Colonel Wilson of Grant's staff. The way in which
such a trip as this of Wilson and mine was managed
in those days is told in this letter to a child, written just
before we left Chattanooga for Knoxville:</p>

<div class='letter'>

<p>I expect to go all the way on horseback, and it will
take about five days. About seventy horsemen will go
along with their sabers and carbines to keep off the
guerillas. Our baggage we shall have carried on pack
mules. These are funny little rats of creatures, with the
big panniers fastened to their sides to carry their burdens
in. I shall put my bed in one pannier and my
carpet bag and India-rubber things in the other. Colonel
Wilson, who is to go with me, will have another
mule for his traps, and a third will carry the bread and
meat and coffee that we are to live on. At night we
shall halt in some nice shady nook where there is a
spring, build a big roaring fire, cook our supper, spread
our blankets on the ground, and sleep with our feet
toward the fire, while half a dozen of the soldiers, with
their guns ready loaded, watch all about to keep the
rebels at a safe distance. Then in the morning we shall
first wake up, then wash our faces, get our breakfasts,
and march on, like John Brown's soul, toward our
destination. How long I shall stay at Knoxville is uncertain,
but I hope not very long&mdash;though it must be
very charming in that country of mountains and rivers&mdash;and
then I shall pray for orders that will take me
home again.</p></div>

<p>We were not obliged to camp out every night on this
trip. One evening, just about supper time, we reached<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>
a large stone house, the home of a farmer. The man,
we found, was a strong Unionist, and he gave us a
hearty invitation to occupy his premises. Our escort
took possession of the barn for sleeping, and we cooked
our supper in the yard, the family lending us a table and
sending us out fresh bread. After supper Wilson and I
were invited into the house, where the farmer listened
eagerly to the news of the Union army. There were
two or three young and very pretty girls in the farmer's
family, and while we talked they dipped snuff, a peculiar
custom that I had seen but once or twice before.</p>

<p>We reached Knoxville on the 13th, and I at once
went to headquarters to talk over the situation with
Burnside. This was the first time I had met that general.
He was rather a large man physically, about six
feet tall, with a large face and a small head, and heavy
side whiskers. He was an energetic, decided man, frank,
manly, and well educated. He was a very showy officer&mdash;not
that he <em>made</em> any show; he was naturally that.
When he first talked with you, you would think he had
a great deal more intelligence than he really possessed.
You had to know him some time before you really took
his measure.</p>

<p>I found that Burnside's forces, something like thirty-three
thousand men of all arms, were scattered all the
way from Kentucky, by Cumberland Gap, down to
Knoxville. In and about Knoxville he had not concentrated
more than twelve thousand to fourteen thousand
men. The town was fortified, though unable to
resist an attack by a large force. Up to this time Burnside
and his army had really been very well off, for he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>
had commanded a rich region behind Knoxville, and
thence had drawn food and forage. He even had about
one hundred miles of railroad in active operation for
foraging, and he had plenty of mills and workshops in
the town which he could use.</p>

<p>After a detailed conversation with Burnside, I concluded
that there was no reason to believe that any
force had been sent from Lee's army to attack him on
the northeast, as we had heard in Chattanooga, but that
it was certain that Longstreet was approaching from
Chattanooga with thirty thousand troops. Burnside
said that he would be unable long to resist such an attack,
and that if Grant did not succeed in making a
demonstration which would compel Longstreet to return
he must retreat.</p>

<p>If compelled to retreat, he proposed, he said, to follow
the line of Cumberland Gap, and to hold Morristown
and Bean's Station. At these points he would be
secure against any force the enemy could bring against
him; he would still be able to forage over a large extent
of country on the south and east, he could prevent
the repair of the railroads by the rebels, and he would
still have an effective hold on East Tennessee.</p>

<p>A few hours after this talk with Burnside, about one
o'clock in the morning of the 14th, a report reached
Knoxville that completely upset his plan for retreating
by Cumberland Gap. This was the news that the enemy
had commenced building bridges across the Tennessee
near Loudon, only about twenty-five miles south
of Knoxville. Burnside immediately decided that he
must retreat; and he actually dictated orders for draw<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>ing
his whole army south of the Holston into Blount
County, where all his communications would have been
cut off, and where on his own estimate he could not
have subsisted more than three weeks. General Parke
argued against this in vain, but finally Colonel Wilson
overcame it by representing that Grant did not wish
Burnside to include the capture of his entire army
among the plans of his operations. He then determined
to retreat toward the gaps, after destroying the
workshops and mills in Knoxville and on the line of
his march.</p>

<p>Before we left, however, which was about six o'clock
in the morning of the 14th, General Burnside had begun
to feel that perhaps he might not be obliged to pass
the mountains and abandon East Tennessee entirely.
He had even decided to send out a force to attack the
enemy's advance. When Wilson and I reached Lenoir's
Station that morning on our way to Chattanooga,
we discovered that the enemy's attack was not
as imminent as Burnside feared. Their bridges were
not complete, and no artillery or cavalry had crossed.
From everything I could learn of their strength, in fact,
it seemed to me that there was a reasonable probability
that Burnside would be able to hold Knoxville until relieved
by operations at Chattanooga.</p>

<p>We found that our departure from Knoxville had
been none too soon. So completely were the Confederates
taking possession of the country between Knoxville
and Chattanooga that had we delayed a single
day we could have got out only through Cumberland
Gap or that of Big Creek. We were four days in return<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>ing,
and Mr. Stanton became very uneasy, as I learned
from this dispatch received soon after my return:</p>

<div class='letter'>

<p class='nr9right'>
<span class="smcap">War Department</span>,</p>
<p class='nr5right'><span class="smcap">Washington, D.C.</span>, <i class='date'>November 19, 1863</i>.</p>

<p>Hon. <span class="smcap">C. A. Dana</span>, Chattanooga.
</p>

<p>Your dispatches of yesterday are received. I am
rejoiced that you have got safely back. My anxiety
about you for several days had been very great. Make
your arrangements to remain in the field during the
winter. Continue your reports as frequently as possible,
always noting the hour.</p>

<p class='nr5right'>
<span class="smcap">Edwin M. Stanton.</span>
</p></div>

<p>Colonel Wilson and I reached Chattanooga on November
17th. As soon as I arrived I went to Grant's
and Thomas's headquarters to find out the news. There
was the greatest hopefulness everywhere. Sherman,
they told me, had reached Bridgeport, and a plan for
attacking Bragg's position was complete and its execution
begun by moving a division of Sherman's army
from Bridgeport to Trenton, where it ought to arrive
that day, threatening the enemy by Stevens's Gap. The
remainder of that army was to move into Lookout
Valley by way of Whiteside, extending its lines up
the valley toward Trenton, as if to repeat the flanking
movement of Rosecrans when he followed Bragg across
the Tennessee. Having drawn the enemy's attention to
that quarter, Sherman was to disappear on the night
of the 18th and encamp his forces behind the ridge of
hills north of the Tennessee, opposite to Chattanooga,
and keep them there out of sight of the enemy during
the 19th. That same night a bridge was to be thrown
across the river just below the mouth of Chickamauga<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>
Creek, so that on Saturday morning, November 20th,
Sherman's command would be across before daylight, if
possible. As soon as over he was to push for the head
of Missionary Ridge, and there engage the enemy.</p>

<p>At the same time that Sherman's wing advanced,
Granger, with about eighteen thousand men, was to
move up on the left of the Chattanooga lines and engage
the Confederate right with all possible vigor.
Hooker, who had been in the Lookout Valley ever since
he joined the army in November, was to attack the
head of Lookout Mountain simultaneously with Sherman's
attack at the head of Missionary Ridge, and, if
practicable, to carry the mountain.</p>

<p>It is almost never possible to execute a campaign
as laid out, especially when it requires so many concerted
movements as this one. Thus, instead of all of
Sherman's army crossing the Tennessee on the night
of the 18th, and getting out of sight as expected behind
the hills that night, a whole corps was left behind
at daylight, and one division had to march down the
valley on the morning of the 20th in full view of the
enemy, who now understood, of course, that he was to
be attacked. Bragg evidently did not care to risk a
battle, for he tried to alarm Grant that afternoon by
sending a flag over, and with it a letter, saying, "As
there may still be some non-combatants in Chattanooga,
I deem it proper to notify you that prudence would
dictate their early withdrawal." Of course, we all knew
this was a bluff.</p>

<p>On the morning of the 20th a heavy rain began,
which lasted two days and made the roads so bad that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>
Sherman's advance was almost stopped. His march
was still further retarded by a singular blunder which had
been committed in moving his forces from Bridgeport.
Instead of moving all the troops and artillery first,
the numerous trains which had been brought from West
Tennessee were sent in front rather than in rear of each
division. Grant said the blunder was his; that he should
have given Sherman explicit orders to leave his wagons
behind; but no one was so much astonished as Grant
on learning that they had not been left, even without
such orders.</p>

<p>Owing to these unforeseen circumstances, Sherman's
rear was so far behind on the morning of the
23d, three days after Grant had planned for the attack,
that it was doubtful whether he could be ready to join
the movement the next day, November 24th. It was
also feared that the enemy, who had seen the troops
march through Lookout Valley and then disappear,
might have discovered where they were concealed, and
thus surmise our movements.</p>

<p>On account of these hitches in carrying out the
operations as speedily as Grant had hoped, it was not
until November 23d that the first encounter in the battle
of Chattanooga occurred. It was the beginning of
the most spectacular military operations I ever saw&mdash;operations
extending over three days and full of the
most exciting incidents.</p>

<p>Our army lay to the south and east of the town of
Chattanooga, the river being at our back. Facing us, in
a great half circle, and high above us on Lookout Mountain
and Missionary Ridge, were the Confederates. Our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>
problem was to drive them from these heights. We
had got our men well together, all the re-enforcements
were up, and now we were to strike.</p>

<p>The first thing Grant tried to do was to clear out
the Confederate lines which were nearest to ours on the
plain south of Chattanooga, and to get hold of two bald
knobs, or low hills, where Bragg's forces had their advance
guard. As the entire field where this attack was
to be made was distinctly visible from one of our forts,
I went there on the 23d with the generals to watch the
operations. The troops employed for the attack were
under the immediate orders of Gordon Granger. There
were some capital officers under Granger, among them
Sheridan, Hazen, and T. J. Wood. Just before one
o'clock the men moved out of their intrenchments, and
remained in line for three quarters of an hour in full view
of the enemy. The spectacle was one of singular magnificence.</p>

<p>Our point of view was Fort Wood. Usually in a
battle one sees only a little corner of what is going on,
the movements near where you happen to be; but in
the battle of Chattanooga we had the whole scene before
us. At last, everything being ready, Granger gave
the order to advance, and three brigades of men pushed
out simultaneously. The troops advanced rapidly, with
all the precision of a review, the flags flying and the
bands playing. The first sign of a battle one noticed
was the fire spitting out of the rifles of the skirmishers.
The lines moved steadily along, not halting at all, the
skirmishers all the time advancing in front, firing and
receiving fire.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span></p>

<p>The first shot was fired at two o'clock, and in five
minutes Hazen's skirmishers were briskly engaged, while
the artillery of Forts Wood and Thomas was opening
upon the rebel rifle-pits and camps behind the line of
fighting. The practice of our gunners was splendid, but
it elicited no reply from the camps and batteries of the
enemy, about a mile and three quarters distant; and it
was soon evident that the Confederates had no heavy
artillery, in that part of their lines at least. Our troops,
rapidly advancing toward the knobs upon which they
were directed, occupied them at twenty minutes past
two. Ten minutes later Samuel Beatty, who commanded
a brigade, driving forward across an open
field, carried the rifle-pits in his front, the occupants
fleeing as they fired their last volley; and Sheridan,
moving through the forest which stretched before him,
drove in the enemy's pickets. Sheridan halted his advance,
in obedience to orders, on reaching the rifle-pits,
where the rebel force was waiting for his attack. No
such attack was made, however, the design being to
secure only the height. The entire movement was
carried out in such an incredibly short time that at half
past three I was able to send a telegram to Mr. Stanton
describing the victory.</p>

<p>We took about two hundred prisoners, mostly Alabama
troops, and had gained a position which would
be of great importance should the enemy still attempt
to hold the Chattanooga Valley. With these heights
in our possession, a column marching to turn Missionary
Ridge was secure from flank attack. The Confederates
fired three small guns only during the affair, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>
that tended to confirm the impression that they had
withdrawn their main force. About four o'clock in the
afternoon the enemy opened fire from the top of Missionary
Ridge, the total number of cannon they displayed
being about twelve, but nothing was developed
to show decisively whether they would fight or flee.
Grant thought the latter; other judicious officers the
former.</p>

<p>That evening I left Chattanooga to join General
Sherman, who had his troops north of the river concealed
behind the hills, and ready to attempt to cross
the Tennessee that very night, so as to be able to attack
the east head of Missionary Ridge on the night of
the 24th or the morning of the 25th.</p>

<p>Sherman had some twenty-five thousand men, and
crossing them over a river as wide and rapid as the Tennessee
was above Chattanooga seemed to me a serious
task, and I watched the operations of the night with
great curiosity. The first point was to get a sufficient
body of troops on the south bank to hold a position
against the enemy (the Confederates had pickets for a
long distance up and down the Tennessee, above Chattanooga),
and then from there commence building the
pontoon bridge by which the bulk of the men were to
be got over.</p>

<p>About one o'clock in the morning the pontoon boats,
which had been sent up the river some distance, were
filled with men and allowed to drop down to the point
General Sherman had chosen for the south end of his
bridge. They landed about 2.30 in the morning, seized
the pickets, and immediately began to fortify their posi<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>tion.
The boats in the meantime were sent across the
river to bring over fresh loads of men. They kept this
up until morning. Then a small steamer which Sherman
had got hold of came up and began to bring over
troops. At daybreak some of the boats were taken
from the ferrying and a bridge was begun. It was marvelous
with what vigor the work went on. Sherman
told me he had never seen anything done so quietly
and so well, and he declared later in his report that he
did not believe the history of war could show a bridge
of that length&mdash;about thirteen hundred and fifty feet&mdash;laid
down so noiselessly and in so short a time. By
one o'clock in the afternoon (November 24th) the bridge
was done, and the balance of his forces were soon
marching briskly across. As soon as Sherman saw that
the crossing was insured, he set the foremost of his
column in motion for the head of Missionary Ridge.
By four o'clock he had gained the crest of the ridge
and was preparing for the next day's battle.</p>

<p>As soon as I saw Sherman in position, I hurried back
to Chattanooga. I reached there just in time to see the
famous moonlight battle on Lookout Mountain. The
way this night battle happened to be fought was that
Hooker, who had been holding Lookout Valley, had
been ordered to gain a foothold on Lookout Mountain
if possible, and that day, while I was with Sherman, had
really succeeded in scaling the side of the mountain.
But his possession of the point he had reached had been
so hotly disputed that a brigade had been sent from
Chattanooga to aid him. These troops attacked the
Confederate lines on the eastern slope of the mountain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>
about eight o'clock that evening. A full moon made
the battlefield as plain to us in the valley as if it were
day, the blaze of their camp fires and the flashes of their
guns displaying brilliantly their position and the progress
of their advance. No report of the result was received
that night, but the next morning we knew that
Bragg had evacuated Lookout Mountain the night before,
and that our troops occupied it.</p>

<p>After the successes of the two days a decisive battle
seemed inevitable, and orders were given that night
for a vigorous attack the next morning. I was up early,
sending my first dispatch to Mr. Stanton at half past
seven o'clock. As the result of the operations of the
day before, Grant held the point of Lookout Mountain
on the southwest and the crest of the east end of Missionary
Ridge, and his line was continuous between
these points. As the result of the movement on November
23d, our lines in front had been advanced to Orchard
Knob. The bulk of the Confederate force was
intrenched along Missionary Ridge, five to six hundred
feet above us, and facing our center and left. From
Chattanooga we could see the full length of our own
and the enemy's lines spread out like a scene in a
theater.</p>

<p>About nine o'clock the battle was commenced on
Sherman's line on our left, and it raged furiously all
that forenoon both east of Missionary Ridge and along
its crest, the enemy making vigorous efforts to crush
Sherman and dislodge him from his position on the
ridge. All day, while this battle was going on, I was at
Orchard Knob, where Grant, Thomas, Granger, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>
several other officers were observing the operations.
The enemy kept firing shells at us, I remember, from the
ridge opposite. They had got the range so well that
the shells burst pretty near the top of the elevation
where we were, and when we saw them coming we
would duck&mdash;that is, everybody did except Generals
Grant and Thomas and Gordon Granger. It was not
according to their dignity to go down on their marrow
bones. While we were there Granger got a cannon&mdash;how
he got it I do not know&mdash;and he would
load it with the help of one soldier and fire it himself
over at the ridge. I recollect that Rawlins was very
much disgusted at the guerilla operations of Granger,
and induced Grant to order him to join his troops
elsewhere.</p>

<p>As we thought we perceived, soon after noon, that
the enemy had sent a great mass of their troops to crush
Sherman, Grant gave orders at two o'clock for an assault
upon the left of their lines; but owing to the fault
of Granger, who was boyishly intent upon firing his
gun instead of commanding his corps, Grant's order was
not transmitted to the division commanders until he
repeated it an hour later.</p>

<p>It was fully four o'clock before the line moved out
to the attack. It was a bright, sunny afternoon, and,
as the forces marched across the valley in front of us as
regularly as if on parade, it was a great spectacle. They
took with ease the first rifle-pits at the foot of the ridge
as they had been ordered, and then, to the amazement
of all of us who watched on Orchard Knob, they moved
out and up the steep ahead of them, and before we real<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>ized
it they were at the top of Missionary Ridge. It
was just half past four when I wired to Mr. Stanton:</p>

<div class='letter'>

<p>Glory to God! the day is decisively ours. Missionary
Ridge has just been carried by the magnificent
charge of Thomas's troops, and the rebels routed.</p></div>

<p>As soon as Grant saw the ridge was ours, he started
for the front. As he rode the length of the lines, the
men, who were frantic with joy and enthusiasm over the
victory, received him with tumultuous shouts. The
storming of the ridge by our troops was one of the
greatest miracles in military history. No man who
climbs the ascent by any of the roads that wind along
its front can believe that eighteen thousand men were
moved in tolerably good order up its broken and crumbling
face unless it was his fortune to witness the deed.
It seemed as awful as a visible interposition of God.
Neither Grant nor Thomas intended it. Their orders
were to carry the rifle-pits along the base of the ridge
and capture their occupants; but when this was accomplished,
the unaccountable spirit of the troops bore them
bodily up those impracticable steeps, in spite of the
bristling rifle-pits on the crest, and the thirty cannons
enfilading every gully. The order to storm appears to
have been given simultaneously by Generals Sheridan
and Wood because the men were not to be held back,
dangerous as the attempt appeared to military prudence.
Besides, the generals had caught the inspiration
of the men, and were ready themselves to undertake
impossibilities.</p>

<p>The first time I saw Sheridan after the battle I said
to him, "Why did you go up there?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span></p>

<p>"When I saw the men were going up," he replied,
"I had no idea of stopping them; the rebel pits had
been taken and nobody had been hurt, and after they
had started I commanded them to go right on. I
looked up at the head of the ridge as I was going up,
and there I saw a Confederate general on horseback.
I had a silver whisky flask in my pocket, and when I
saw this man on the top of the hill I took out my flask
and waved my hand toward him, holding up the shining,
glittering flask, and then I took a drink. He
waved back to me, and then the whole corps went up."</p>

<p>All the evening of the 25th the excitement of the
battle continued. Bragg had retreated down the Chickamauga
Valley and was burning what he could not carry
away, so that the east was lit by his fires, while Sheridan
continued his fight along the east slope of Missionary
Ridge until nine o'clock in the evening. It was a bright
moonlight night, and we could see most of the operations
as plainly as by day. The next morning Bragg
was in full retreat. I went to Missionary Ridge in the
morning, and from there I could see along ten miles
of Chickamauga Valley the fires of the depots and
bridges he was burning as he fled.</p>

<p>At intervals throughout the day I sent dispatches to
Washington, where they were eagerly read, as the following
telegram sent me on the 27th shows:</p>

<div class='letter'>

is sick, but both receive your dispatches regularly and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>esteem them highly, not merely because they are reliable,
but for their clearness of narrative and their
graphic pictures of the stirring events they describe.</p>

<p>The patient endurance and spirited valor exhibited
by commanders and men in the last great feat of arms,
which has crowned our cause with such a glorious success,
is making all of us hero worshipers.</p>

<span class="smcap">P. H. Watson</span>,</p>

</p></div>

<p>The enemy was now divided. Bragg was flying
toward Rome and Atlanta, and Longstreet was in East
Tennessee besieging Burnside. Our victorious army
was between them. The first thought was, of course, to
relieve Burnside, and Grant ordered Granger with the
Fourth Corps instantly forward to his aid, taking pains
to write Granger a personal letter, explaining the exigencies
of the case and the imperative need of energy.
It had no effect, however, in hastening the movement,
and a day or two later Grant ordered Sherman to assume
command of all the forces operating from the
south to save Knoxville. Grant became imbued with a
strong prejudice against Granger from this circumstance.</p>

<p>As any movement against Bragg was impracticable
at that season, the only operations possible to Grant,
beyond the relief of Burnside, were to hold Chattanooga
and the line of the Hiwassee, to complete and protect
the railroads and the steamboats upon the Tennessee,
and to amass food, forage, and ordnance stores for the
future. But all this would require only a portion of
the forces under his command; and, instead of holding
the remainder in winter quarters, he evolved a plan to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>
employ them in an offensive winter campaign against
Mobile and the interior of Alabama. He asked me to
lay his plan before Mr. Stanton, and urge its approval
by the Government, which, of course, I did at once by
telegraph.</p>

<p>I did not wait at Chattanooga to learn the decision
of the Government on Grant's plan, but left on November
29th, again with Colonel Wilson, to join Sherman,
now well on his way to Knoxville, and to observe his
campaign.</p>

<p>I fell in with Sherman on November 30th at Charleston,
on the Hiwassee. The Confederate guard there
fled at his approach, after half destroying the bridges,
and we had to stay there until one was repaired. When
we reached Loudon, on December 3d, the bridge over
the Tennessee was gone, so that the main body of the
army marched to a point where it was believed a practicable
ford might be found. The ford, however, proved
too deep for the men, the river being two hundred yards
wide, and the water almost at freezing point. We had
a great deal of fun getting across. I remember my
horse went through&mdash;swam through, where his feet
could not strike the ground&mdash;and I got across without
any difficulty. I think Wilson got across, too; but
when the lieutenant of our squad of cavalrymen got in
the middle of the river, where it was so deep that as he
sat in the saddle the water came up to his knees almost,
and a little above the breast of the mule he rode, the
animal turned his head upward toward the current,
at that place very strong, and would not stir. This
poor fellow sat there in the middle of the stream, and,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>
do his best, he could not move his beast. Finally, they
drove in a big wagon, or truck, with two horses, and
tied that to the bits of the mule, and dragged him out.</p>

<p>Colonel Wilson at once set about the construction of
a trestle bridge, and by working all night had it so advanced
that the troops could begin to cross by daylight
the next morning.</p>

<p>While the crossing was going on, we captured a
Confederate mail, and first learned something authentic
about Burnside. He had been assailed by Longstreet
on the 29th of November, but had repulsed him. He
was still besieged, and all the letter writers spoke of the
condition in the town with great despondency, evidently
regarding their chance of extrication as very poor.
Longstreet, we gathered from the mail, thought that
Sherman was bringing up only a small force.</p>

<p>By noon of December 5th we had our army over,
and, as we were now only thirty-five miles from Knoxville,
we pushed ahead rapidly, the enemy making but
little resistance. When Longstreet discovered the
strength of our force he retreated, and we entered Knoxville
at noon on the 6th. We found to our surprise
that General Burnside had fully twenty days' provisions&mdash;much
more, in fact, than at the beginning of
the siege. These supplies had been drawn from the
French Broad by boats, and by the Sevierville road.
The loyal people of East Tennessee had done their
utmost through the whole time to send in provisions
and forage, and Longstreet left open the very avenues
which Burnside most desired. We found ammunition
very short, and projectiles for our rifle guns had been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>
made in the town. The utmost constancy and unanimity
had prevailed during the whole siege, from Burnside
down to the last private; no man thought of retreat
or surrender.</p>

<p>The next morning after our arrival, December 7th,
Sherman started back to Chattanooga with all his force
not needed there. Colonel Wilson and I returned with
him, reaching Chattanooga on December 10th.</p>

<p class='p2'>Everything in the army was now so safe, quiet, and
regular that I felt I could be more useful anywhere else,
so the day I got back I asked leave of Mr. Stanton to
go North. I did not wait for his reply, however. The
morning of the 12th Grant sent for me to come to his
headquarters, and asked me to go to Washington to
represent more fully to Stanton and Halleck his wishes
with regard to the winter campaign. As the matter was
important, I started at once, telegraphing Mr. Stanton
that, if he thought it unnecessary for me to go, orders
would reach me at any point on the railroad.</p>

<h3>THE WAR DEPARTMENT IN WAR TIMES.</h3>

<div class='intro'>

<p>Grant's plans blocked by Halleck&mdash;Mr. Dana on duty at Washington&mdash;Edwin
McMasters Stanton&mdash;His deep religious feeling&mdash;His swift
intelligence and almost superhuman energy&mdash;The Assistant Secretary's
functions&mdash;Contract supplies and contract frauds&mdash;Lincoln's
intercession for dishonest contractors with political influence&mdash;A
characteristic letter from Sherman.</p></div>


<p>I reached Washington about the middle of December,
and immediately gave to Mr. Stanton an outline
of Grant's plan and reasons for a winter campaign.
The President, Mr. Stanton, and General Halleck all
agreed that the proposed operations were the most
promising in sight; indeed, Mr. Stanton was enthusiastic
in favor of the scheme as I presented it to him.
He said that the success of Grant's campaign would
end the war in the Mississippi Valley, and practically
make prisoners of all the rebel forces in the interior of
Mississippi and Alabama, without our being at the direct
necessity of guarding and feeding them. But
Halleck, as a <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">sine qua non</i>, insisted that East Tennessee
should first be cleared out and Longstreet driven off
permanently and things up to date secured, before new
campaigns were entered upon.</p>

<p>The result was that no winter campaign was made in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>
1863-'64 toward the Alabama River towns and Mobile.
Its success, in my opinion, was certain, and I so represented
to Mr. Stanton. Without jeoparding our interests
in any other quarter, Grant would have opened
the Alabama River and captured Mobile a full year before
it finally fell. Its success meant permanent security
for everything we had already laid hold of, at once
freeing many thousands of garrison troops for service
elsewhere. As long as the rebels held Alabama,
they had a base from which to strike Tennessee. I had
unbounded confidence in Grant's skill and energy to
conduct such a campaign into the interior, cutting loose
entirely from his base and subsisting off the enemy's
country. At the time he had the troops, and could
have finished the job in three months.</p>

<p>After I had explained fully my mission from Grant,
I asked the Secretary what he wanted me to do. Mr.
Stanton told me he would like to have me remain in
the department until I was needed again at the front.
Accordingly, an office in the War Department was provided
for me, and I began to do the regular work of
an assistant to the Secretary of War. This was the
first time since my relations with the War Department
began that I had been thrown much with the Secretary,
and I was very glad to have an opportunity to observe
him.</p>

<p>Mr. Stanton was a short, thick, dark man, with a
very large head and a mass of black hair. His nature
was intense, and he was one of the most eloquent men
that I ever met. Stanton was entirely absorbed in his
duties, and his energy in prosecuting them was some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>thing
almost superhuman. When he took hold of the
War Department the armies seemed to grow, and they
certainly gained in force and vim and thoroughness.</p>

<p>One of the first things which struck me in Mr. Stanton
was his deep religious feeling and his familiarity
with the Bible. He must have studied the Bible a great
deal when he was a boy. He had the firmest conviction
that the Lord directed our armies. Over and over
again have I heard him express the same opinion which
he wrote to the Tribune after Donelson: "Much has
recently been said of military combinations and organizing
victory. I hear such phrases with apprehension.
They commenced in infidel France with the Italian
campaign, and resulted in Waterloo. Who can organize
victory? Who can combine the elements of success
on the battlefield? We owe our recent victories
to the Spirit of the Lord, that moved our soldiers to
rush into battle, and filled the hearts of our enemies
with dismay. The inspiration that conquered in battle
was in the hearts of the soldiers and from on high; and
wherever there is the same inspiration there will be the
same results." There was never any cant in Stanton's
religious feeling. It was the straightforward expression
of what he believed and lived, and was as simple and
genuine and real to him as the principles of his business.</p>

<p>Stanton was a serious student of history. He had
read many books on the subject&mdash;more than on any
other, I should say&mdash;and he was fond of discussing historical
characters with his associates; not that he made
a show of his learning. He was fond, too, of discussing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>
legal questions, and would listen with eagerness to the
statement of cases in which friends had been interested.
He was a man who was devoted to his friends, and he
had a good many with whom he liked to sit down and
talk. In conversation he was witty and satirical; he
told a story well, and was very companionable.</p>

<p>There is a popular impression that Mr. Stanton took
a malevolent delight in browbeating his subordinates,
and every now and then making a spectacle of some
poor officer or soldier, who unfortunately fell into his
clutches in the Secretary's reception room, for the edification
of bystanders. This idea, like many other false
notions concerning great men, is largely a mistaken
one. The stories which are told of Mr. Stanton's impatience
and violence are exaggerated. He could speak
in a very peremptory tone, but I never heard him say
anything that could be called vituperative.</p>

<p>There were certain men in whom he had little faith,
and I have heard him speak to some of these in a tone
of severity. He was a man of the quickest intelligence,
and understood a thing before half of it was told him.
His judgment was just as swift, and when he got hold
of a man who did not understand, who did not state
his case clearly, he was very impatient.</p>

<p>If Stanton liked a man, he was always pleasant. I
was with him for several years in the most confidential
relations, and I can now recall only one instance of his
speaking to me in a harsh tone. It was a curious case.
Among the members of Congress at that period was a
Jew named Strouse. One of Strouse's race, who lived
in Virginia, had gone down to the mouth of the James<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>
River when General Butler was at Fortress Monroe,
and had announced his wish to leave the Confederacy.
Now, the orders were that when a man came to a commanding
officer with a request to go through the lines,
he was to be examined and all the money he had was
to be taken from him. General Butler had taken from
this Virginian friend of Strouse between fifty thousand
and seventy-five thousand dollars. When a general
took money in this way he had to deposit it at once in
the Treasury; there a strict account was kept of the
amount, whom it was taken by, and whom it was taken
from. Butler gave a receipt to this man, and he afterward
came to Washington to get his money. He and
Strouse came to the War Department, where they
bothered Mr. Stanton a good deal. Finally, Mr. Stanton
sent for me.</p>

<p>"Strouse is after me," he said; "he wants that
money, and I want you to settle the matter."</p>

<p>"What shall I do?" I asked; "what are the orders?"
He took the papers in the case and wrote on
the back of them:</p>

<div class='letter'>

<p>Referred to Mr. Dana, Assistant Secretary of War,
to be settled as in his judgment shall be best.</p>

<p class='nr5right'>
<span class="smcap">E. M. Stanton.</span>
</p></div>

<p>The man then turned his attention from the Secretary
to me. I looked into the matter, and gave him
back the money. The next day Mr. Stanton sent for
me. I saw he was angry.</p>

<p>"Did you give that Jew back his money?" he asked
in a harsh tone.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span></p>

<p>"Well," he said, "I should like to know by what
authority you did it."</p>

<p>"If you will excuse me while I go to my room, I
will show my authority to you," I replied.</p>

<p>So I went up and brought down the paper he had
indorsed, and read to him:</p>

<p>"Referred to Mr. Dana, Assistant Secretary of War,
to be settled as in his judgment shall be best." Then I
handed it over to him. He looked at it, and then he
laughed.</p>

<p>"You are right," he said; "you have got me this
time." That was the only time he spoke to me in a
really harsh tone.</p>

<p>At the time that I entered the War Department for
regular duty, it was a very busy place. Mr. Stanton
frequently worked late at night, keeping his carriage
waiting for him. I never worked at night, as my eyes
would not allow it. I got to my office about nine
o'clock in the morning, and I stayed there nearly the
whole day, for I made it a rule never to go away until
my desk was cleared. When I arrived I usually found
on my table a big pile of papers which were to be acted
on, papers of every sort that had come to me from the
different departments of the office.</p>

<p>The business of the War Department during the
first winter that I spent in Washington was something
enormous. Nearly $285,000,000 was paid out that
year (from June, 1863, to June, 1864) by the quartermaster's
office, and $221,000,000 stood in accounts at
the end of the year awaiting examination before payment
was made. We had to buy every conceivable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>
thing that an army of men could need. We bought fuel,
forage, furniture, coffins, medicine, horses, mules, telegraph
wire, sugar, coffee, flour, cloth, caps, guns, powder,
and thousands of other things. Sometimes our
supplies came by contract; again by direct purchase;
again by manufacture. Of course, by the fall of 1863
the army was pretty well supplied; still, that year we
bought over 3,000,000 pairs of trousers, nearly 5,000,000
flannel shirts and drawers, some 7,000,000 pairs of
stockings, 325,000 mess pans, 207,000 camp kettles,
over 13,000 drums, and 14,830 fifes. It was my duty
to make contracts for many of these supplies.</p>

<p>In making contracts for supplies of all kinds, we
were obliged to take careful precautions against frauds.
I had a colleague in the department, the Hon. Peter
H. Watson, the distinguished patent lawyer, who had
a great knack at detecting army frauds. One which
Watson had spent much time in trying to ferret out
came to light soon after I went into office. This was
an extensive fraud in forage furnished to the Army of
the Potomac. The trick of the fraud consisted in a dishonest
mixture of oats and Indian corn for the horses
and mules of the army. By changing the proportions
of the two sorts of grain, the contractors were able to
make a considerable difference in the cost of the bushel,
on account of the difference in the weight and price
of the grain, and it was difficult to detect the cheat.
However, Watson found it out, and at once arrested
the men who were most directly involved.</p>

<p>Soon after the arrest Watson went to New York.
While he was gone, certain parties from Philadelphia<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>
interested in the swindle came to me at the War Department.
Among them was the president of the Corn
Exchange. They paid me thirty-three thousand dollars
to cover the sum which one of the men confessed he
had appropriated; thirty-two thousand dollars was the
amount restored by another individual. The morning
after this transaction the Philadelphians returned to me,
demanding both that the villains should be released, and
that the papers and funds belonging to them, taken
at the time of their arrest, should be restored. It was
my judgment that, instead of being released, they should
be remanded to solitary confinement until they could
clear up all the forage frauds and make complete justice
possible. Then I should have released them, but not
before. So I telegraphed to Watson what had happened,
and asked him to return to prevent any false
step.</p>

<p>Now, it happened that the men arrested were of
some political importance in Pennsylvania, and eminent
politicians took a hand in getting them out of
the scrape. Among others, the Hon. David Wilmot,
then Senator of the United States and author of the
famous Wilmot proviso, was very active. He went to
Mr. Lincoln and made such representations and appeals
that finally the President consented to go with him
over to the War Department and see Watson in his
office. Wilmot remained outside, and Mr. Lincoln
went in to labor with the Assistant Secretary. Watson
eloquently described the nature of the fraud, and
the extent to which it had already been developed
by his partial investigation. The President, in reply,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>
dwelt upon the fact that a large amount of money had
been refunded by the guilty men, and urged the greater
question of the safety of the cause and the necessity
of preserving united the powerful support which Pennsylvania
was giving to the administration in suppressing
the rebellion. Watson answered:</p>

<p>"Very well, Mr. President, if you wish to have these
men released, all that is necessary is to give the order;
but I shall ask to have it in writing. In such a case as
this it would not be safe for me to obey a verbal order;
and let me add that if you do release them the fact and
the reason will necessarily become known to the
people."</p>

<p>Finally Mr. Lincoln took up his hat and went out.
Wilmot was waiting in the corridor, and came to meet
him.</p>

<p>"Wilmot," he said, "I can't do anything with Watson;
he won't release them."</p>

<p>The reply which the Senator made to this remark
can not be printed here, but it did not affect the judgment
or the action of the President.</p>

<p>The men were retained for a long time afterward.
The fraud was fully investigated, and future swindles
of the kind were rendered impossible. If Watson could
have had his way, the guilty parties&mdash;and there were
some whose names never got to the public&mdash;would
have been tried by military commission and sternly
dealt with. But my own reflections upon the subject
led me to the conclusion that the moderation of the
President was wiser than the unrelenting justice of the
Assistant Secretary would have been.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span></p>

<p>Not a little of my time at the department was taken
up with people who had missions of some kind within
the lines of the army. I remember one of these particularly,
because it brought me a characteristic letter
from General Sherman. There was much suffering
among the loyal citizens and the Quakers of East Tennessee
in the winter of 1863-'64, and many relief committees
came to us seeking transportation and safe conduct
for themselves and their supplies into that country.
Some of these were granted, to the annoyance of
General Sherman, then in command of the Military
Division of the Mississippi. The reasons for his objections
he gave in this letter to me:</p>

<div class='letter'>

<p class='center'>
<span class="smcap">Headquarters Military Division of the Mississippi</span>,</p>
<p class='nr5right'><span class="smcap">Nashville, Tenn.</span>, <i class='date'>April 21, 1864</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">C. A. Dana</span>, Esq., Ass't Sec. of War, Washington.
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">My dear Friend</span>: It may be parliamentary, but is
not military, for me to write you; but I feel assured
anything I may write will only have the force of a casual
conversation, such as we have indulged in by the camp
fire or as we jogged along by the road. The text of
my letter is one you gave a Philadelphia gentleman who
is going up to East Tennessee to hunt up his brother
Quakers and administer the bounties of his own and his
fellow-citizens' charity. Now who would stand in the
way of one so kindly and charitably disposed? Surely
not I. But other questions present themselves. We
have been working hard with tens of thousands of men,
and at a cost of millions of dollars, to make railroads to
carry to the line of the Tennessee enough provisions
and material of war to enable us to push in our physical
force to the next stop in the war. I have found on
personal inspection that hitherto the railroads have
barely been able to feed our men, that mules have died
by the thousand, that arms and ammunition had [have]
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>laid in the depot for two weeks for want of cars, that no
accumulation at all of clothing and stores had been
or could be moved at Chattanooga, and that it took
four sets of cars and locomotives to accommodate the
passes given by military commanders; that gradually
the wants of citizens and charities were actually consuming
the real resources of a road designed exclusively
for army purposes. You have been on the spot and
can understand my argument. At least one hundred
citizens daily presented good claims to go forward&mdash;women
to attend sick children, parents in search of the
bodies of some slain in battle, sanitary committees sent
by States and corporations to look after the personal
wants of their constituents, ministers and friends to minister
to the Christian wants of their flocks; men who
had fled, anxious to go back to look after lost families,
etc.; and, more still, the tons of goods which they all
bore on their merciful errands. None but such as you,
who have been present and seen the tens, hundreds,
and thousands of such cases, can measure them in the
aggregate and segregate the exceptions.</p>

<p>I had no time to hesitate, for but a short month was
left me to prepare, and I must be ready to put in motion
near one hundred thousand men to move when naught
remains to save life. I figured up the mathematics, and
saw that I must have daily one hundred and forty-five
car loads of essentials for thirty days to enable me to
fill the requirement. Only seventy-five daily was all
the roads were doing. Now I have got it up to one
hundred and thirty-five. Troops march, cattle go by
the road, sanitary and sutler's stores limited, and all is
done that human energy can accomplish. Yet come
these pressing claims of charity, by men and women
who can not grasp the great problem. My usual answer
is, "Show me that your presence at the front is more
valuable than two hundred pounds of powder, bread,
or oats"; and it is generally conclusive. I have given
Mr. Savery a pass on your letter, and it takes two hundred
pounds of bread from our soldiers, or the same
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>of oats from our patient mules; but I could not promise
to feed the suffering Quakers at the expense of our
army. I have ordered all who can not provide food
at the front to be allowed transportation back in our
empty cars; but I can not undertake to transport the
food needed by the worthy East Tennesseeans or any
of them. In peace there is a beautiful harmony in all
the departments of life&mdash;they all fit together like the
Chinese puzzle; but in war all is ajar. Nothing fits,
and it is the struggle between the stronger and weaker;
and the latter, however it may appeal to the better feelings
of our nature, must kick the beam. To make war
we must and will harden our hearts.</p>

<p>Therefore, when preachers clamor and the sanitaries
wail, don't join in, but know that war, like the thunderbolt,
follows its laws, and turns not aside even if the
beautiful, the virtuous, and charitable stand in its path.</p>

<p>When the day and the hour comes, I'll strike Joe
Johnston, be the result what it may; but in the time allotted
to me for preparation I must and will be selfish
in making those preparations which I know to be necessary.</p>

and Chase&mdash;Gideon Welles&mdash;Friction between Stanton
and Blair&mdash;Personal traits of the President&mdash;Lincoln's surpassing
ability as a politician&mdash;His true greatness of character and intellect&mdash;His

<p>During the first winter I spent in Washington in
the War Department I had constant opportunities of
seeing Mr. Lincoln, and of conversing with him in the
cordial and unofficial manner which he always preferred.
Not that there was ever any lack of dignity in the man.
Even in his freest moments one always felt the presence
of a will and of an intellectual power which maintained
the ascendancy of his position. He never posed, or put
on airs, or attempted to make any particular impression;
but he was always conscious of his own ideas and purposes,
even in his most unreserved moments.</p>

<p>I knew, too, and saw frequently, all the members
of his Cabinet. When Mr. Lincoln was inaugurated as
President, his first act was to name his Cabinet; and
it was a common remark at the time that he had put
into it every man who had competed with him for the
nomination. The first in importance was William H.
Seward, of New York, Mr. Lincoln's most prominent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span>
competitor. Mr. Seward was made Secretary of State.
He was an interesting man, of an optimistic temperament,
and he probably had the most cultivated and
comprehensive intellect in the administration. He was
a man who was all his life in controversies, yet he was
singular in this, that, though forever in fights, he had
almost no personal enemies. Seward had great ability
as a writer, and he had what is very rare in a lawyer,
a politician, or a statesman&mdash;imagination. A fine illustration
of his genius was the acquisition of Alaska. That
was one of the last things that he did before he went
out of office, and it demonstrated more than anything
else his fixed and never-changing idea that all North
America should be united under one government.</p>

<p>Mr. Seward was an admirable writer and an impressive
though entirely unpretentious speaker. He stood
up and talked as though he were engaged in conversation,
and the effect was always great. It gave the impression
of a man deliberating "out loud" with himself.</p>

<p>The second man in importance and ability to be put
into the Cabinet was Mr. Chase, of Ohio. He was an
able, noble, spotless statesman, a man who would have
been worthy of the best days of the old Roman republic.
He had been a candidate for the presidency, though
a less conspicuous one than Seward. Mr. Chase was a
portly man; tall, and of an impressive appearance, with
a very handsome, large head. He was genial, though
very decided, and occasionally he would criticise the
President, a thing I never heard Mr. Seward do. Chase
had been successful in Ohio politics, and in the Treasury<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>
Department his administration was satisfactory to the
public. He was the author of the national banking law.
I remember going to dine with him one day&mdash;I did
that pretty often, as I had known him well when I was
on the Tribune&mdash;and he said to me: "I have completed
to-day a very great thing. I have finished the National
Bank Act. It will be a blessing to the country long after
I am dead."</p>

<p>The Secretary of the Navy throughout the war was
Gideon Welles, of Connecticut. Welles was a curious-looking
man: he wore a wig which was parted in the
middle, the hair falling down on each side; and it was
from his peculiar appearance, I have always thought,
that the idea that he was an old fogy originated. I remember
Governor Andrew, of Massachusetts, coming
into my office at the War Department one day and asking
where he could find "that old Mormon deacon, the
Secretary of the Navy." In spite of his peculiarities, I
think Mr. Welles was a very wise, strong man. There
was nothing decorative about him; there was no noise
in the street when he went along; but he understood
his duty, and did it efficiently, continually, and unvaryingly.
There was a good deal of opposition to him, for
we had no navy when the war began, and he had to
create one without much deliberation; but he was patient,
laborious, and intelligent at his task.</p>

<p>Montgomery Blair was Postmaster-General in Mr.
Lincoln's Cabinet. He was a capable man, sharp, keen,
perhaps a little cranky, and not friendly with everybody;
but I always found him pleasant to deal with, and I saw
a great deal of him. He and Mr. Stanton were not very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>
good friends, and when he wanted anything in the War
Department he was more likely to come to an old friend
like me than to go to the Secretary. Stanton, too,
rather preferred that.</p>

<p>The Attorney-General of the Cabinet was Edward
Bates, of Missouri. Bates had been Mr. Greeley's favorite
candidate for the presidency. He was put into
the Cabinet partly, I suppose, because his reputation
was good as a lawyer, but principally because he had
been advocated for President by such powerful influences.
Bates must have been about sixty-eight years
old when he was appointed Attorney-General. He was
a very eloquent speaker. Give him a patriotic subject,
where his feelings could expand, and he would make
a beautiful speech. He was a man of very gentle, cordial
nature, but not one of extraordinary brilliancy.</p>

<p>The relations between Mr. Lincoln and the members
of his Cabinet were always friendly and sincere on
his part. He treated every one of them with unvarying
candor, respect, and kindness; but, though several of
them were men of extraordinary force and self-assertion&mdash;this
was true especially of Mr. Seward, Mr. Chase,
and Mr. Stanton&mdash;and though there was nothing of self-hood
or domination in his manner toward them, it was
always plain that he was the master and they the subordinates.
They constantly had to yield to his will in
questions where responsibility fell upon him. If he ever
yielded to theirs, it was because they convinced him
that the course they advised was judicious and appropriate.
I fancied during the whole time of my intimate
intercourse with him and with them that he was always<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>
prepared to receive the resignation of any one of them.
At the same time I do not recollect a single occasion
when any member of the Cabinet had got his mind
ready to quit his post from any feeling of dissatisfaction
with the policy or conduct of the President. Not that
they were always satisfied with his actions; the members
of the Cabinet, like human beings in general, were
not pleased with everything. In their judgment much
was imperfect in the administration; much, they felt,
would have been done better if their views had been
adopted and they individually had had charge of it.
Not so with the President. He was calm, equable, uncomplaining.
In the discussion of important questions,
whatever he said showed the profoundest thought, even
when he was joking. He seemed to see every side of
every question. He never was impatient, he never was
in a hurry, and he never tried to hurry anybody else. To
every one he was pleasant and cordial. Yet they all
felt it was his word that went at last; that every case
was open until he gave his decision.</p>

<p>This impression of authority, of reserve force, Mr.
Lincoln always gave to those about him. Even physically
he was impressive. According to the record measurements,
he was six feet four inches in height. That
is, he was at least four inches taller than the tall, ordinary
man. When he rode out on horseback to review
an army, as I have frequently seen him do, he wore usually
a high hat, and then he looked like a giant. There
was no waste or excess of material about his frame;
nevertheless, he was very strong and muscular. I remember
that the last time I went to see him at the White<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span>
House&mdash;the afternoon before he was killed&mdash;I found
him in a side room with coat off and sleeves rolled up,
washing his hands. He had finished his work for the
day, and was going away. I noticed then the thinness
of his arms, and how well developed, strong, and active
his muscles seemed to be. In fact, there was nothing
flabby or feeble about Mr. Lincoln physically. He was
a very quick man in his movements when he chose to
be, and he had immense physical endurance. Night
after night he would work late and hard without being
wilted by it, and he always seemed as ready for the next
day's work as though he had done nothing the day
before.</p>

<p>Mr. Lincoln's face was thin, and his features were
large. His hair was black, his eyebrows heavy, his forehead
square and well developed. His complexion was
dark and quite sallow. His smile was something most
lovely. I have never seen a woman's smile that approached
it in its engaging quality; nor have I ever seen
another face which would light up as Mr. Lincoln's
did when something touched his heart or amused him.
I have heard it said that he was ungainly, that his step
was awkward. He never impressed me as being awkward.
In the first place, there was such a charm and
beauty about his expression, such good humor and
friendly spirit looking from his eyes, that when you were
near him you never thought whether he was awkward
or graceful; you thought of nothing except, What a
kindly character this man has! Then, too, there was
such shrewdness in his kindly features that one did not
care to criticise him. His manner was always dignified,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>
and even if he had done an awkward thing the dignity
of his character and manner would have made it seem
graceful and becoming.</p>

<p>The great quality of his appearance was benevolence
and benignity: the wish to do somebody some good if
he could; and yet there was no flabby philanthropy
about Abraham Lincoln. He was all solid, hard, keen
intelligence combined with goodness. Indeed, the expression
of his face and of his bearing which impressed
one most, after his benevolence and benignity, was his
intelligent understanding. You felt that here was a
man who saw through things, who understood, and
you respected him accordingly.</p>

<p>Lincoln was a supreme politician. He understood
politics because he understood human nature. I had
an illustration of this in the spring of 1864. The administration
had decided that the Constitution of the United
States should be amended so that slavery should be prohibited.
This was not only a change in our national
policy, it was also a most important military measure.
It was intended not merely as a means of abolishing
slavery forever, but as a means of affecting the judgment
and the feelings and the anticipations of those in
rebellion. It was believed that such an amendment to
the Constitution would be equivalent to new armies in
the field, that it would be worth at least a million men,
that it would be an intellectual army that would tend to
paralyze the enemy and break the continuity of his
ideas.</p>

<p>In order thus to amend the Constitution, it was
necessary first to have the proposed amendment ap<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span>proved
by three fourths of the States. When that question
came to be considered, the issue was seen to be so
close that one State more was necessary. The State of
Nevada was organized and admitted into the Union
to answer that purpose. I have sometimes heard people
complain of Nevada as superfluous and petty, not big
enough to be a State; but when I hear that complaint,
I always hear Abraham Lincoln saying, "It is easier
to admit Nevada than to raise another million of soldiers."</p>

<p>In March, 1864, the question of allowing Nevada
to form a State government finally came up in the
House of Representatives. There was strong opposition
to it. For a long time beforehand the question
had been canvassed anxiously. At last, late one afternoon,
the President came into my office, in the third
story of the War Department. He used to come there
sometimes rather than send for me, because he was fond
of walking and liked to get away from the crowds in
the White House. He came in and shut the door.</p>

<p>"Dana," he said, "I am very anxious about this
vote. It has got to be taken next week. The time is
very short. It is going to be a great deal closer than I
wish it was."</p>

<p>"There are plenty of Democrats who will vote for
it," I replied. "There is James E. English, of Connecticut;
I think he is sure, isn't he?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes; he is sure on the merits of the question."</p>

<p>"Then," said I, "there's 'Sunset' Cox, of Ohio.
How is he?"</p>

<p>"He is sure and fearless. But there are some others<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span>
that I am not clear about. There are three that you can
deal with better than anybody else, perhaps, as you
know them all. I wish you would send for them."</p>

<p>He told me who they were; it isn't necessary to repeat
the names here. One man was from New Jersey
and two from New York.</p>

<p>"What will they be likely to want?" I asked.</p>

<p>"I don't know," said the President; "I don't know.
It makes no difference, though, what they want. Here
is the alternative: that we carry this vote, or be compelled
to raise another million, and I don't know how
many more, men, and fight no one knows how long.
It is a question of three votes or new armies."</p>

<p>"Well, sir," said I, "what shall I say to these gentlemen?"</p>

<p>"I don't know," said he; "but whatever promise
you make to them I will perform."</p>

<p>I sent for the men and saw them one by one. I
found that they were afraid of their party. They said
that some fellows in the party would be down on them.
Two of them wanted internal revenue collector's appointments.
"You shall have it," I said. Another one
wanted a very important appointment about the custom
house of New York. I knew the man well whom he
wanted to have appointed. He was a Republican,
though the congressman was a Democrat. I had served
with him in the Republican county committee of New
York. The office was worth perhaps twenty thousand
dollars a year. When the congressman stated the case,
I asked him, "Do you want that?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said he.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span></p>

<p>"Well," I answered, "you shall have it."</p>

<p>"I understand, of course," said he, "that you are
not saying this on your own authority?"</p>

<p>"Oh, no," said I; "I am saying it on the authority
of the President."</p>

<p>Well, these men voted that Nevada be allowed to
form a State government, and thus they helped secure
the vote which was required. The next October the
President signed the proclamation admitting the State.
In the February following Nevada was one of the States
which ratified the Thirteenth Amendment, by which
slavery was abolished by constitutional prohibition in
all of the United States. I have always felt that this
little piece of side politics was one of the most judicious,
humane, and wise uses of executive authority that I
have ever assisted in or witnessed.</p>

<p>The appointment in the New York Custom House
was to wait until the term of the actual incumbent had
run out. My friend, the Democratic congressman, was
quite willing. "That's all right," he said; "I am in
no hurry." Before the time had expired, Mr. Lincoln
was murdered and Andrew Johnson became President.
I was in the West, when one day I got a telegram
from Roscoe Conkling:</p>

<p>"Come to Washington." So I went.</p>

<p>"I want you to go and see President Johnson," Mr. Conkling
said, "and tell him that the appointment of
this man to the custom house is a sacred promise of
Mr. Lincoln's, and that it must be kept."</p>

<p>Then I went to the White House, and saw President
Johnson.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span></p>

<p>"This is Mr. Lincoln's promise," I urged. "He
regarded it as saving the necessity of another call for
troops and raising, perhaps, a million more men to
continue the war. I trust, Mr. President, that you will
see your way clear to execute this promise."</p>

<p>"Well, Mr. Dana," he replied, "I don't say that I
won't; but I have observed in the course of my experience
that such bargains tend to immorality."</p>

<p>The appointment was not made. I am happy to say,
however, that the gentleman to whom the promise was
given never found any fault either with President Lincoln
or with the Assistant Secretary who had been the
means of making the promise to him.</p>

<p>One of the cleverest minor political moves which
Mr. Lincoln ever made was an appointment he once
gave Horace Greeley. Mr. Greeley never approved of
Mr. Lincoln's manner of conducting the war, and he
sometimes abused the President roundly for his deliberation.
As the war went on, Greeley grew more and
more irritable, because the administration did not make
peace on some terms. Finally, in July, 1864, he received
a letter from a pretended agent of the Confederate authorities
in Canada, saying:</p>

<div class='letter'>

<p>I am authorized to state to you for our use only, not
the public, that two ambassadors of Davis and Company
are now in Canada with full and complete powers for a
peace, and Mr. Sanders requests that you come on immediately
to me at Cataract House to have a private
interview; or, if you will send the President's protection
for him and two friends, they will come on and meet
you. He says the whole matter can be consummated
by me, them, and President Lincoln.</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span></p>

<p>This letter was followed the next day by a telegram,
saying: "Will you come here? Parties have full
power."</p>

<p>Upon receiving this letter, Mr. Greeley wrote to
President Lincoln, more or less in the strain of the articles
that he had published in the Tribune. He complained
bitterly of the way the business of the Government
was managed in the great crisis, and told the President
that now there was a way open to peace. He explained
that the Confederates wanted a conference, and
he told Mr. Lincoln that he thought that he ought to
appoint an ambassador, or a diplomatic agent, of the
United States Government, to meet the Confederate
agents at Niagara and hear what they had to say. Mr. Lincoln
immediately responded by asking Mr. Greeley
to be himself the representative and to go to Niagara
Falls.</p>

<p>"If you can find any person anywhere," the President
wrote, "professing to have any proposition of Jefferson
Davis, in writing, for peace, embracing the
restoration of the Union, and abandonment of slavery,
whatever else it embraces, say to him he may come to
me with you, and that if he really brings such proposition
he shall at the least have safe conduct with the
paper (and without publicity, if he chooses) to the point
where you shall have met him. The same, if there be
two or more persons."</p>

<p>Mr. Greeley went to Niagara, but his mission ended
in nothing, except that the poor man, led astray by too
great confidence, failed in his undertaking, and was
almost universally laughed at. I saw the President not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>
long after that, and he said, with a funny twinkle in his
eye: "I sent Brother Greeley a commission. I guess
I am about even with him now."</p>

<p>Lincoln had the most comprehensive, the most judicious
mind; he was the least faulty in his conclusions
of any man I have ever known. He never stepped too
soon, and he never stepped too late. When the whole
Northern country seemed to be clamoring for him to
issue a proclamation abolishing slavery, he didn't do
it. Deputation after deputation went to Washington.
I remember once a hundred gentlemen, dressed in black
coats, mostly clergymen, from Massachusetts, came to
Washington to appeal to him to proclaim the abolition
of slavery. But he did not do it. He allowed Mr.
Cameron and General Butler to execute their great idea
of treating slaves as contraband of war and protecting
those who had got into our lines against being recaptured
by their Southern owners; but he would not prematurely
make the proclamation that was so much desired.
Finally the time came, and of that he was the
judge. Nobody else decided it; nobody commanded
it; the proclamation was issued as he thought best, and
it was efficacious. The people of the North, who during
the long contest over slavery had always stood
strenuously by the compromises of the Constitution,
might themselves have become half rebels if this proclamation
had been issued too soon. At last they were
tired of waiting, tired of endeavoring to preserve even
a show of regard for what was called "the compromises
of the Constitution" when they believed the Constitution
itself was in danger. Thus public opinion was ripe<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span>
when the proclamation came, and that was the beginning
of the end. He could have issued this proclamation
two years before, perhaps, and the consequence of
it might have been our entire defeat; but when it came
it did its work, and it did us no harm whatever. Nobody
protested against it, not even the Confederates
themselves.</p>

<p>This unerring judgment, this patience which waited
and which knew when the right time had arrived, is an
intellectual quality that I do not find exercised upon
any such scale and with such absolute precision by any
other man in history. It proves Abraham Lincoln to
have been intellectually one of the greatest of rulers. If
we look through the record of great men, where is
there one to be placed beside him? I do not know.</p>

<p>Another interesting fact about Abraham Lincoln
is that he developed into a great military man; that is
to say, a man of supreme military judgment. I do not
risk anything in saying that if one will study the records
of the war and study the writings relating to it, he will
agree with me that the greatest general we had, greater
than Grant or Thomas, was Abraham Lincoln. It was
not so at the beginning; but after three or four years
of constant practice in the science and art of war, he
arrived at this extraordinary knowledge of it, so that
Von Moltke was not a better general, or an abler planner
or expounder of a campaign, than was President
Lincoln. To sum it up, he was a born leader of men.
He knew human nature; he knew what chord to strike,
and was never afraid to strike it when he believed that
the time had arrived.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span></p>

<p>Mr. Lincoln was not what is called an educated man.
In the college that he attended a man gets up at daylight
to hoe corn, and sits up at night by the side of a
burning pine-knot to read the best book he can find.
What education he had, he had picked up. He had read
a great many books, and all the books that he had
read he knew. He had a tenacious memory, just as he
had the ability to see the essential thing. He never
took an unimportant point and went off upon that; but
he always laid hold of the real question, and attended
to that, giving no more thought to other points than
was indispensably necessary.</p>

<p>Thus, while we say that Mr. Lincoln was an uneducated
man in the college sense, he had a singularly perfect
education in regard to everything that concerns the
practical affairs of life. His judgment was excellent, and
his information was always accurate. He knew what
the thing was. He was a man of genius, and contrasted
with men of education the man of genius will always
carry the day. Many of his speeches illustrate this.</p>

<p>I remember very well Mr. Stanton's comment on the
Gettysburg speeches of Edward Everett and Mr. Lincoln.
"Edward Everett has made a speech," he said,
"that will make three columns in the newspapers, and
Mr. Lincoln has made a speech of perhaps forty or fifty
lines. Everett's is the speech of a scholar, polished to
the last possibility. It is elegant, and it is learned; but
Lincoln's speech will be read by a thousand men where
one reads Everett's, and will be remembered as long
as anybody's speeches are remembered who speaks in
the English language."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span></p>

<p>That was the truth. Who ever thinks of or reads
Everett's Gettysburg speech now? If one will compare
those two speeches he will get an idea how superior
genius is to education; how superior that intellectual
faculty is which sees the vitality of a question and knows
how to state it; how superior that intellectual faculty
is which regards everything with the fire of earnestness
in the soul, with the relentless purpose of a heart devoted
to objects beyond literature.</p>

<p>Another remarkable peculiarity of Mr. Lincoln's
was that he seemed to have no illusions. He had no
freakish notions that things were so, or might be so,
when they were not so. All his thinking and reasoning,
all his mind, in short, was based continually upon
actual facts, and upon facts of which, as I said, he saw
the essence. I never heard him say anything that was
not so. I never heard him foretell things; he told what
they were, but I never heard him intimate that such
and such consequences were likely to happen without
the consequences following. I should say, perhaps, that
his greatest quality was wisdom. And that is something
superior to talent, superior to education. It is
again genius; I do not think it can be acquired. All
the advice that he gave was wise, and it was always
timely. This wisdom, it is scarcely necessary to add,
had its animating philosophy in his own famous words,
"With malice toward none, with charity for all."</p>

<p>Another remarkable quality of Mr. Lincoln was his
great mercifulness. A thing it seemed as if he could
not do was to sign a death warrant. One day General
Augur, who was the major general commanding the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>
forces in and around Washington, came to my office and
said:</p>

<p>"Here is So-and-So, a spy. He has been tried by
court-martial; the facts are perfectly established, he has
been sentenced to death, and here is the warrant for his
execution, which is fixed for to-morrow morning at six
o'clock. The President is away. If he were here, the
man certainly wouldn't be executed. He isn't here. I
think it very essential to the safety of the service and
the safety of everything that an example should be
made of this spy. They do us great mischief; and it is
very important that the law which all nations recognize
in dealing with spies, and the punishment which every
nation assigns to them, should be inflicted upon at least
one of these wretches who haunt us around Washington.
Do you know whether the President will be back
before morning?"</p>

<p>"I understand that he won't be back until to-morrow
afternoon," I replied.</p>

<p>"Well, as the President is not here, will you sign
the warrant?"</p>

<p>"Go to Mr. Stanton," I said; "he is the authority."</p>

<p>"I have been to him, and he said I should come to
you."</p>

<p>Well, I signed the order; I agreed with General
Augur in his view of the question. At about eleven
o'clock the next day I met the general. "The President
got home at two o'clock this morning," he said, "and
he stopped it all."</p>

<p>But it was not only in matters of life and death that
Mr. Lincoln was merciful. He was kind at heart to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span>ward
all the world. I never heard him say an unkind
thing about anybody. Now and then he would laugh
at something jocose or satirical that somebody had done
or said, but it was always pleasant humor. He would
never allow the wants of any man or woman to go unattended
to if he could help it. I noticed his sweetness
of nature particularly with his little son, a child at that
time perhaps seven or nine years old, who used to roam
the departments and whom everybody called "Tad."
He had a defective palate, and couldn't speak very
plainly. Often I have sat by his father, reporting to him
some important matter that I had been ordered to inquire
into, and he would have this boy on his knee.
While he would perfectly understand the report, the
striking thing about him was his affection for the child.</p>

<p class='p2'>He was good to everybody. Once there was a great
gathering at the White House on New Year's Day, and
all the diplomats came in their uniforms, and all the
officers of the army and navy in Washington were in
full costume. A little girl of mine said, "Papa, couldn't
you take me over to see that?" I said, "Yes"; so I
took her over and put her in a corner, where she beheld
this gorgeous show. When it was finished, I went
up to Mr. Lincoln and said, "I have a little girl here
who wants to shake hands with you." He went over
to her, and took her up and kissed her and talked to
her. She will never forget it if she lives to be a thousand
years old.</p>

<p>I remained in Washington the entire winter of
1863-'64, occupied mainly with the routine business of
the department. Meantime the Chattanooga victory
had made Grant the great military figure of the country,
and deservedly so. The grade of lieutenant general
had been immediately revived by act of Congress,
and the President had promptly promoted him to the
new rank, and made him general in chief of all the
armies of the United States. His military prestige was
such that everything was put into his hands, everything
yielded to his wishes. The coming of Grant was a great
relief to the President and the Secretary. Halleck, the
late general in chief, consented to serve as Grant's chief
of staff in Washington, practically continuing his old
service of chief military adviser to the President and the
Secretary of War, while Grant took the field in active
direction of operations against Richmond.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span></p>

<p>Halleck was not thought to be a great man in the
field, but he was nevertheless a man of military ability,
and by reason of his great accomplishments in the technics
of armies and of war was almost invaluable as an
adviser to the civilians Lincoln and Stanton. He was
an honest man, perhaps somewhat lacking in moral
courage, yet earnest and energetic in his efforts to sustain
the national government. I have heard Halleck
accused of being unjust to his inferiors in rank, especially
to Grant. I believe this wrong. I never thought
him unjust to anybody. He always had his own ideas,
and insisted strenuously on following his own course,
but I never detected a sign of injustice in his conduct
toward others. I think this false impression came from
the fact that he was a very critical man. The first impulse
of his mind toward a new plan was not enthusiasm;
it was analysis, criticism. His habit of picking men
and manners to pieces to see what they were worth gave
the idea that he was unjust and malicious toward certain
of his subordinates.</p>

<p>It was March when Grant came to Washington to
receive his new grade of lieutenant general. Soon afterward
he joined the Army of the Potomac. On the 4th
of May he had moved out from Culpeper, where the
army had been in winter quarters since the previous
December, and crossed the Rapidan with an effective
force of one hundred and twenty thousand men. General
Lee, his opponent, had about seventy thousand.</p>

<p>For two days after Grant moved we had no authentic
reports from the army, although it was known that great
events were occurring. Mr. Stanton and Mr. Lincoln<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span>
had begun to get uneasy. The evening of May 6th
I was at a reception when a messenger came with summons
to the War Department. I hurried over to the
office in evening dress. The President was there, talking
very soberly with Stanton.</p>

<p>"Dana," said Mr. Lincoln, "you know we have
been in the dark for two days since Grant moved. We
are very much troubled, and have concluded to send
you down there. How soon can you start?"</p>

<p>"In half an hour," I replied.</p>

<p>In about that time I had an engine fired up at Alexandria,
and a cavalry escort of a hundred men awaiting
me there. I had got into my camp clothes, had borrowed
a pistol, and with my own horse was aboard the
train at Maryland Avenue that was to take me to Alexandria.
My only baggage was a tooth-brush. I was
just starting when an orderly galloped up with word
that the President wished to see me. I rode back to
the department in hot haste. Mr. Lincoln was sitting
in the same place.</p>

<p>"Well, Dana," said he, looking up, "since you went
away I've been thinking about it. I don't like to send
you down there."</p>

<p>"But why not, Mr. President?" I asked, a little surprised.</p>

<p>"You can't tell," continued the President, "just
where Lee is or what he is doing, and Jeb Stuart is rampaging
around pretty lively in between the Rappahannock
and the Rapidan. It's a considerable risk, and I
don't like to expose you to it."</p>

<p>"Mr. President," I said, "I have a cavalry guard<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span>
ready and a good horse myself. If we are attacked, we
probably will be strong enough to fight. If we are not
strong enough to fight, and it comes to the worst, we
are equipped to run. It's getting late, and I want to
get down to the Rappahannock by daylight. I think
I'll start."</p>

<p>"Well, now, Dana," said the President, with a little
twinkle in his eyes, "if you feel that way, I rather wish
you would. Good night, and God bless you."</p>

<p>By seven o'clock on the morning of May 7th I was
at the Rappahannock, where I found a rear guard of the
army. I stopped there for breakfast, and then hurried
on to Grant's headquarters, which were at Piney Branch
Meeting House. There I learned of the crossing of the
Rapidan by our army, and of the desperate battle of
the Wilderness on May 5th and 6th.</p>

<p>The Army of the Potomac was then composed of
the Second, Fifth, Sixth, and Ninth Army Corps, and
of one cavalry corps. In command of the army was
Major-General George C. Meade. He was a tall, thin
man, rather dyspeptic, I should suppose from the fits
of nervous irritation to which he was subject. He was
totally lacking in cordiality toward those with whom he
had business, and in consequence was generally disliked
by his subordinates. With General Grant Meade got
along always perfectly, because he had the first virtue
of a soldier&mdash;that is, obedience to orders. He was an
intellectual man, and agreeable to talk with when his
mind was free, but silent and indifferent to everybody
when he was occupied with that which interested him.</p>

<p>As a commander, Meade seemed to me to lack the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span>
boldness that was necessary to bring the war to a close.
He lacked self-confidence and tenacity of purpose, and
he had not the moral authority that Grant had attained
from his grand successes in other fields. As soon as
Meade had a commander over him he was all right, but
when he himself was the commander he began to hesitate.
Meade had entirely separate headquarters and a
separate staff, and Grant sent his orders to him.</p>

<p>In command of the Second Army Corps was Major-General
W. S. Hancock. He was a splendid fellow,
a brilliant man, as brave as Julius C√¶sar, and always
ready to obey orders, especially if they were fighting
orders. He had more of the aggressive spirit than almost
anybody else in that army. Major-General G. K.
Warren, who commanded the Fifth Army Corps, was
an accomplished engineer. Major-General John Sedgwick
commanded the Sixth Army Corps. I had known
him for over twenty years. Sedgwick graduated at
West Point in 1837, and was appointed a second lieutenant
in the Second Artillery. At the time of the McKenzie
rebellion in Canada Sedgwick's company was
stationed at Buffalo during a considerable time. I was
living in Buffalo then, and in this rebellion the young
men of the town organized a regiment of city guards,
and I was a sergeant in one of those companies, so that
I became quite familiar with all the military movements
then going on. Then it was that I got acquainted with
Sedgwick. He was a very solid man; no flummery
about him. You could always tell where Sedgwick
was to be found, and in a battle he was apt to be found
where the hardest fighting was. He was not an ardent,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span>
impetuous soldier like Hancock, but was steady and
sure.</p>

<p>Two days after I reached the army, on May 9th,
not far from Spottsylvania Courthouse, my old friend
Sedgwick was killed. He had gone out in the morning
to inspect his lines, and, getting beyond the point of
safety, was struck in the forehead by a sharpshooter and
instantly killed. The command of the Sixth Army Corps
was given to General H. G. Wright. Wright was another
engineer officer, well educated, of good, solid intellect,
with capacity for command, but no special
predilection for fighting. From the moment Meade
assumed command of the army, two days before Gettysburg,
the engineers rapidly came to the front, for Meade
had the pride of corps strongly implanted in his heart.</p>

<p>Major-General Burnside, whom I had last seen at
Knoxville in December, was in command of the Ninth
Army Corps. Immediately after the siege of Knoxville,
at his own request, Burnside had been relieved
of the command in East Tennessee by Major-General
John G. Foster. The President somehow always showed
for Burnside great respect and good will. After Grant's
plans for the spring campaign were made known, the
Ninth Corps was moved by rail to Annapolis, where it
was recruited up to about twenty-five thousand men.
As the time for action neared it was set in motion, and
by easy marches reached and re-enforced the Army of
the Potomac on the morning of the 6th of May, in the
midst of the battle of the Wilderness. It was not formally
incorporated with that army until later, but, by
a sort of fiction, it was held to be a distinct army, Burn<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span>side
acting in concert with Meade, and receiving his
orders directly from Grant, as did Meade. These two
armies were the excuse for Grant's personal presence,
without actually superseding Meade.</p>

<p>In my opinion, the great soldier of the Army of
the Potomac at this time was General Humphreys. He
was the chief of staff to General Meade, and was a strategist,
a tactician, and an engineer. Humphreys was a
fighter, too, and in this an exception to most engineers.
He was a very interesting figure. He used to ride about
in a black felt hat, the brim of which was turned down
all around, making him look like a Quaker. He was
very pleasant to deal with, unless you were fighting
against him, and then he was not so pleasant. He was
one of the loudest swearers that I ever knew. The men
of distinguished and brilliant profanity in the war were
General Sherman and General Humphreys&mdash;I could not
mention any others that could be classed with them.
General Logan also was a strong swearer, but he was
not a West Pointer: he was a civilian. Sherman and
Humphreys would swear to make everything blue when
some dispatch had not been delivered correctly or they
were provoked. Humphreys was a very charming man,
quite destitute of vanity. I think he had consented to
go and serve with Meade as chief of staff out of pure
patriotism. He preferred an active command, and
eventually, on the eve of the end, succeeded to the command
of the Second Corps, and bore a conspicuous part
in the Appomattox campaign.</p>

<p>Meade was in command of the Army of the Potomac,
but it was Grant, the lieutenant general of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span>
armies of the United States, who was really directing
the movements. The central idea of the campaign had
not developed to the army when I reached headquarters,
but it was soon clear to everybody. Grant's great
operation was the endeavor to interpose the Federal
army between Lee's army and Richmond, so as to cut
Lee off from his base of supplies. He meant to get
considerably in advance of Lee&mdash;between him and Richmond&mdash;thus
compelling Lee to leave his intrenchments
and hasten southward. If in the collision thus forced
Grant found that he could not smash Lee, he meant to
make another move to get behind his army. That was
to be the strategy of the campaign of 1864. That was
what Lee thwarted, though he had a narrow escape
more than once.</p>

<p>The first encounter with Lee had taken place in the
Wilderness on May 5th and 6th. The Confederates and
many Northern writers love to call the Wilderness a
drawn battle. It was not so; in every essential light
it was a Union victory. Grant had not intended to
fight a battle in those dense, brushy jungles, but Lee
precipitated it just as he had precipitated the battle of
Chancellorsville one year before, and not six miles to
the eastward of this very ground. In doing so he hoped
to neutralize the superior numbers of Grant as he had
Hooker's, and so to mystify and handle the Union leader
as to compel a retreat across the Rapidan. But he
failed. Some of the fighting in the brush was a draw,
but the Union army did not yield a rood of ground;
it held the roads southward, inflicted great losses on
its enemy, and then, instead of recrossing the river, re<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span>sumed
its march toward Richmond as soon as Lee's
attacks had ceased. Lee had palpably failed in his objects.
His old-time tactics had made no impression on
Grant. He never offered general battle in the open
afterward.</p>

<p>The previous history of the Army of the Potomac
had been to advance and fight a battle, then either to
retreat or to lie still, and finally to go into winter quarters.
Grant did not intend to proceed in that way.
As soon as he had fought a battle and had not routed
Lee, he meant to move nearer to Richmond and fight
another battle. But the men in the army had become
so accustomed to the old methods of campaigning that
few, if any, of them believed that the new commander
in chief would be able to do differently from his predecessors.
I remember distinctly the sensation in the
ranks when the rumor first went around that our position
was south of Lee's. It was the morning of May
8th. The night before the army had made a forced
march on Spottsylvania Courthouse. There was no indication
the next morning that Lee had moved in any
direction. As the army began to realize that we were
really moving south, and at that moment were probably
much nearer Richmond than was our enemy, the
spirits of men and officers rose to the highest pitch of
animation. On every hand I heard the cry, "On to
Richmond!"</p>

<p>But there were to be a great many more obstacles
to our reaching Richmond than General Grant himself,
I presume, realized on May 8, 1864. We met one that
very morning; for when our advance reached Spottsyl<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span>vania
Courthouse it found Lee's troops there, ready to
dispute the right of way with us, and two days later
Grant was obliged to fight the battle of Spottsylvania
before we could make another move south.</p>

<p>It is no part of my present plan to go into detailed
description of all the battles of this campaign, but rather
to dwell on the incidents and deeds which impressed me
most deeply at the moment. In the battle of Spottsylvania,
a terrific struggle, with many dramatic features,
there is nothing I remember more distinctly than a little
scene in General Grant's tent between him and a captured
Confederate officer, General Edward Johnson.
The battle had begun on the morning of May 10th, and
had continued all day. On the 11th the armies had
rested, but at half past four on the morning of the 12th
fighting had been begun by an attack by Hancock on
a rebel salient. Hancock attacked with his accustomed
impetuosity, storming and capturing the enemy's fortified
line, with some four thousand prisoners and twenty
cannon. The captures included nearly all of Major-General
Edward Johnson's division, together with Johnson
himself and General George H. Steuart.</p>

<p>I was at Grant's headquarters when General Johnson
was brought in a prisoner. He was a West Pointer,
and had been a captain in the old army before secession,
and was an important officer in the Confederate service,
having distinguished himself in the Valley in 1863,
and at Gettysburg. Grant had not seen him since they
had been in Mexico together. The two men shook
hands cordially, and at once began a brisk conversation,
which was very interesting to me, because nothing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span>
was said in it on the subject in which they were both
most interested just then&mdash;that is, the fight that was
going on, and the surprise that Hancock had effected.
It was the past alone of which they talked.</p>

<p>It was quite early in the morning when Hancock's
prisoners were brought in. The battle raged without
cessation throughout the day, Wright and Hancock
bearing the brunt of it. Burnside made several attacks,
in which his troops generally bore themselves like good
soldiers. The results of the battle of Spottsylvania were
that we had crowded the enemy out of some of his
most important positions, had weakened him by losses
of between nine thousand and ten thousand men killed,
wounded, and captured, besides many battle flags and
much artillery, and that our troops rested victorious
upon the ground they had fought for.</p>

<p>After the battle was over and firing had nearly
ceased, Rawlins and I went out to ride over the field.
We went first to the salient which Hancock had attacked
in the morning. The two armies had struggled for
hours for this point, and the loss had been so terrific
that the place has always been known since as the
"Bloody Angle." The ground around the salient had
been trampled and cut in the struggle until it was almost
impassable for one on horseback, so Rawlins and
I dismounted and climbed up the bank over the outer
line of the rude breastworks. Within we saw a fence
over which earth evidently had been banked, but which
now was bare and half down. It was here the fighting
had been fiercest. We picked our way to this fence, and
stopped to look over the scene. The night was coming<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span>
on, and, after the horrible din of the day, the silence
was intense; nothing broke it but distant and occasional
firing or the low groans of the wounded. I remember
that as I stood there I was almost startled to hear a bird
twittering in a tree. All around us the underbrush and
trees, which were just beginning to be green, had been
riddled and burnt. The ground was thick with dead
and wounded men, among whom the relief corps was
at work. The earth, which was soft from the heavy
rains we had been having before and during the battle,
had been trampled by the fighting of the thousands of
men until it was soft, like thin hasty pudding. Over
the fence against which we leaned lay a great pool of
this mud, its surface as smooth as that of a pond.</p>

<p>As we stood there, looking silently down at it, of
a sudden the leg of a man was lifted up from the pool
and the mud dripped off his boot. It was so unexpected,
so horrible, that for a moment we were stunned.
Then we pulled ourselves together and called to some
soldiers near by to rescue the owner of the leg. They
pulled him out with but little trouble, and discovered
that he was not dead, only wounded. He was taken to
the hospital, where he got well, I believe.</p>

<p>The first news which passed through the ranks the
morning after the battle of Spottsylvania was that Lee
had abandoned his position during the night. Though
our army was greatly fatigued from the enormous efforts
of the day before, the news of Lee's departure inspired
the men with fresh energy, and everybody was
eager to be in pursuit. Our skirmishers soon found the
enemy along the whole line, however, and the conclu<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span>sion
was that their retrograde movement had been made
to correct their position after the loss of the key points
taken from them the day before, and that they were still
with us in a new line as strong as the old one. Of course,
we could not determine this point without a battle, and
nothing was done that day to provoke one. It was
necessary to rest the men.</p>

<p>In changing his lines Lee had left more uncovered
the roads leading southward along his right wing, and
Grant ordered Meade to throw the corps of Warren,
which held the right, and the corps of Wright, which
held the center of Meade's army, to the left of Burnside,
leaving Hancock upon our right. If not interrupted,
Grant thought by this maneuvre to turn Lee's flank and
compel him to move southward.</p>

<p>The movement of the two corps to our left was executed
during the night of May 13th and 14th, but for
three days it had rained steadily, and the roads were
so bad that Wright and Warren did not get up to surprise
the enemy at daylight as ordered. The only engagement
brought on by this move was an active little
fight over a conspicuous hill, with a house and plantation
buildings upon it. The hill, which was on our left
and the enemy's right, was valuable as a lookout rather
than for offensive operations. Upton took it in the
morning, and later the enemy retook it. General Meade,
who was there at that moment, narrowly escaped capture.
Our men very handsomely carried the hill again
that evening.</p>

<p>The two armies were then lying in a semicircle, the
Federal left well around toward the south. We were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span>
concentrated to the last degree, and, so far as we could
tell, Lee's forces were equally compact. On the 15th,
16th, and 17th, we lay in about the same position. This
inactivity was caused by the weather. A pouring rain
had begun on the 11th, and it continued until the morning
of the 16th; the mud was so deep that any offensive
operation, however successful, could not be followed up.
There was nothing to do but lie still and wait for better
weather and drier roads.</p>

<p class='p2'>While waiting for the rain to stop, we had time to
consider the field returns of losses as they were handed
in. The army had left winter quarters at Culpeper
Courthouse on May 4th, and on May 16th the total
of killed, wounded, and missing in both the Army of
the Potomac and the Ninth Corps amounted to a little
over thirty-three thousand men. The missing alone
amounted to forty-nine hundred, but some of these
were, in fact, killed or wounded. When Grant looked
over the returns, he expressed great regret at the loss
of so many men. Meade, who was with him, remarked,
as I remember, "Well, General, we can't do these little
tricks without losses."</p>

<p>By the afternoon of May 17th the weather was splendid,
and the roads were rapidly becoming dry, even
where the mud was worst. Grant determined to engage
Lee, and orders for a decisive movement of the
army were issued, to be executed during the night. At
first he proposed an attack upon the enemy's right,
but changed the plan. Instead of attacking there, Hancock
and Wright made a night march back to our right
flank, and attacked at daylight upon the same lines
where Hancock made his successful assault on the 12th.
They succeeded in pressing close to the enemy's lines,
and for a time were confident that at last they had struck
the lair of the enemy, but an impassable abatis stopped
them. One division of Hancock's corps attempted in
vain to charge through this obstacle, and held the
ground before it for an hour or more under a galling
fire of canister. The difficulty of storming the enemy's
intrenched camp on that side being evidently of the
most extreme character, and both corps having artfully<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span>
but unsuccessfully sought for a weak point where they
might break through, Grant, at nine o'clock, ordered
the attack to cease. The attempt was a failure. Lee
was not to be ousted; and Grant, convinced of it, issued
orders for another movement which he had had in
contemplation for several days, but which he did not
wish to try till after a last attempt to get the enemy
out of his stronghold. This was nothing less than
to slip away from Lee and march on toward Richmond
again.</p>

<p>The new order directed that Hancock's corps should
march by night from its present position southeast as
far toward Richmond on the line of the Fredericksburg
road as he could go, fighting his way if necessary.
Warren was to follow, and, if Lee did not come out and
attack when our army was thus weakened, Wright and
Burnside also were to march southward.</p>

<p>This movement was begun on the night of the 20th.
By the night of the 21st Hancock was across the Mattapony
River at Milford. Warren had crossed the same
river at Guiney's Station, the point to which Grant had
moved his headquarters. By the morning of the 22d
Wright and Burnside were up in safety, and the forward
movement was continued. We were now in a fine,
clear country, good to move in and fight in, and the
advance of the 22d was most successful. By night our
army lay in an east and west line along the Mattapony
River, holding the crossings. On the right was Wright;
close to him at the left, Warren; in the center, Burnside;
on the left, Hancock. Our headquarters were at
New Bethel Church. Our talk that night was that in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span>
all probability we should meet the enemy on the North
Anna, a day's march to the south of our position.</p>

<p>The operations of the next day were much embarrassed
by our ignorance of the road and the entire incorrectness
of our maps; nevertheless, by one o'clock
in the afternoon our right wing, under Warren, reached
the North Anna. The stream there was about one hundred
and fifty feet wide, with bluff banks from fifty to
seventy-five feet high. Wright followed after Warren.
As soon as Warren reached Jericho Mills he pushed his
sharpshooters across the stream, which was easily fordable
at that place, following them with a compact body
of infantry. A Confederate regiment posted to watch
the crossing at once gave way, leaving a single prisoner
in our hands. From this man Warren learned that another
of the enemy's divisions was drawn up to receive
him near by. Under the orders of General Grant, he
promptly threw across the pontoon bridge, over which
he rapidly moved his artillery, at the same time urging
forward his infantry by the ford as well as by the
bridge; and by five o'clock he had transported his entire
command, and had taken up a position of great
strength. Here he rapidly commenced intrenching
himself.</p>

<p>Grant had by this time moved his headquarters up
to Mount Carmel Church, some four miles from Jericho
Mills. About six o'clock we knew from the firing that
Warren had been attacked. I never heard more rapid
or heavier firing, either of artillery or musketry. It
was not until about half past ten that evening that we
knew surely how the fight had gone; then a dispatch<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span>
from Warren announced that he had triumphantly repulsed
the enemy, and made considerable captures of
prisoners.</p>

<p>About the same time that Warren was fighting for
his position at Jericho Mills, Hancock advanced on our
left. By a vigorous charge of two brigades of Birney's
division, the enemy was driven over the North Anna
River. The next morning Hancock crossed over. That
same morning, May 24th, we found that, as a result of
the operations of the previous day, we had about one
thousand prisoners. They were more discouraged
than any set of prisoners I ever saw before. Lee had
deceived them, they said, and they declared that his
army would not fight again except behind breastworks.</p>

<p>The general opinion of every prominent officer in
the army on the morning of the 24th was that the
enemy had fallen back, either to take up a position beyond
the South Anna or to go to Richmond, but by
noon the next day we knew this was a mistake. All
through the day of the 24th Lee blocked our southward
march. The opinion prevailed that the enemy's
position was held by a rear guard only, but the obstinacy
of their skirmishers was regarded as very remarkable.
About dark Hancock made an attack, breaking
into the Confederate line of works, taking some
prisoners, and satisfying himself that a whole corps was
before him. Soon afterward the division of Gibbon
was attacked, but it beat back the assault handsomely
without any considerable loss. Just before dark Crittenden&mdash;the
same Crittenden who was at Chickamauga<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span>
&mdash;was also suddenly attacked, and one of his brigades
damaged. No fighting of any moment took place on
the morning of the 25th, but the enemy showed such
strength as to leave no doubt that Lee's whole army
was present. His intrenchments were in the form of
the letter V. He showed artillery on both faces. By
the morning of the 25th Grant was sure that Lee was
before him and strongly intrenched. He soon determined
on a new move. This was to withdraw his whole
army as quickly as possible, and, before Lee discovered
his intention, to move it southeast, across the Pamunkey,
and perhaps on across the Chickahominy and the
James, if he could not meanwhile get Lee out of his
earthworks.</p>

<p>The orders for the new move were received with the
best spirit by the army, in spite of the fact that the
men were much jaded. Indeed, one of the most important
results of the campaign thus far was the entire
change which had taken place in the feelings of the
armies. The Confederates had lost all confidence, and
were already morally defeated. Our army had learned
to believe that it was sure of ultimate victory. Even
our officers had ceased to regard Lee as an invincible
military genius. On the part of the enemy this change
was evinced not only by their not attacking, even when
circumstances seemed to invite it, but by the unanimous
statements of prisoners taken from them.</p>

<p>The morning after we began to move from our position
on the North Anna I was so confident that I wrote
Mr. Stanton, "Rely upon it, the end is near as well as
sure."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span></p>

<p>It was on the night of the 26th that our army was
withdrawn from the North Anna, without loss or disturbance,
and by the evening of the 27th Grant had
his headquarters ten miles from Hanovertown, and his
whole army was well up toward the crossing. We had
no news of Lee's movements that day, though we heard
that there was a force of the enemy at Hanover Courthouse.
Grant himself was very doubtful that day of
our getting across the Hanover Ferry; he told me that
we might be obliged to go farther to the southeast to
get over. On the morning of the 27th Sheridan and
his cavalry seized the ferry, laying bridges, and, after
crossing, advancing well beyond. Everything went on
finely that night and during the 28th, the troops passing
our headquarters in great numbers and very rapidly.
By noon of the 28th the movement of the army across
the Pamunkey was complete, with the exception of
Burnside, who did not arrive until midnight. The
movement had been executed with admirable celerity
and success. The new position was one of great
strength, our lines extending from the Pamunkey to
Totopotomoy Creek. Wright was on the Pamunkey,
Hancock on his left, and Warren on the Totopotomoy.
The orders for that day were to let the men rest, though
both officers and men were in high spirits at the successful
execution of this long and difficult flank movement.</p>

<p>We were now south of the Pamunkey, and occupying
a very strong position, but we did not know yet
where Lee was. A general reconnaissance was at
once ordered, and the enemy was found in force south<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span>
of the Totopotomoy Creek; by the 30th there was no
doubt that Lee's whole army, now re-enforced by thirteen
thousand men, was close at hand and strongly
intrenched again. Grant said he would fight here if
there was a fair chance, but he declared emphatically
he would not run his head against heavy works.</p>

<p>Our line began to push forward on the 30th. All
the afternoon of that day at headquarters, which were
now at Hawes's Shop, we heard the noise of fighting.
First Warren on the left, who had reached a point only
about seven miles and a half from Richmond, had a
short, sharp, and decisive engagement with Early; and
later an active conflict raged for some time with our
right on the Totopotomoy. We were successful all
along the line. The next day, the 31st, we pushed
ahead until our lines lay from Bethesda Church, on
the east, to the railroad, on the west. Desultory firing
was constantly heard, but there was no very active
fighting that day until about five o'clock in the afternoon,
when Sheridan's cavalry, by hard work, drove
out the enemy and secured Cold Harbor, which was
at that moment of vast importance to us strategically.</p>

<p>It was determined to make a fight here before the
enemy could intrench. Wright was at once ordered to
have his whole force on the ground by daylight on the
1st of June, to support Sheridan and take the offensive.
"Baldy" Smith, of Butler's army, who had landed at
White House on the 31st with twelve thousand five
hundred men, was ordered to the aid of Wright and
Sheridan. But there was an error in Smith's orders,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span>
and Wright's march was so long that his corps did not
get up to Cold Harbor until the afternoon of the 1st.
Meanwhile Sheridan's cavalry had repulsed two attacks
by two brigades of Kershaw's infantry.</p>

<p>It was not until six o'clock in the afternoon that we
at headquarters at Bethesda Church heard the cannon
which indicated that an attack had at last been made
by Wright and Smith. From the sounds of artillery
and musketry, we judged the fight was furious. Rickett's
division broke through the rebel lines between
Hoke and Kershaw, capturing five hundred prisoners,
and forcing the enemy to take up a new position farther
back. Smith's troops effected lodgments close up to
the Confederate intrenchments. Our losses this day
were twenty-two hundred men in these two corps. Warren
was slightly engaged. Altogether they had done
very well, but meanwhile Lee was again concentrated
and intrenched in our front.</p>

<p>Hancock was ordered to move during the night,
and his advance arrived at Cold Harbor about daylight.
When I got up in the morning&mdash;I was then at Bethesda
Church&mdash;his rear was marching past our headquarters.
In conjunction with Wright and Smith, he was to fall
upon Lee's right that day. Warren and Burnside were
also ordered in as soon as they heard that the three
corps on our left had begun battle. There was no battle
that day, however. Hancock's men were so tired with
their forced march of nearly twelve miles, and the heat
and dust were so oppressive, that General Grant ordered
the attack to be postponed until half past four
o'clock the next morning.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span></p>

<p>So the battle Grant sought did not come until June
3d&mdash;that of Cold Harbor. On the morning of the 3d
our line lay with the right at Bethesda Church, the left
extending to the Chickahominy. Hancock commanded
the left; next to him was Wright, with his corps drawn
up in three lines; next, Smith, with the Eighteenth
Corps in two lines; next, Warren, who had his whole
command in a single line, the distance he covered being
fully three miles. With this thin order of battle he was
necessarily unable to make any effective assault. Burnside
held the extreme right. Hancock, Wright, and
Smith were to make the main attacks at daybreak.
Promptly at the hour they dashed out toward the rebel
lines, under a fearful fire of musketry and a cross fire of
artillery. The losses were great, but we gained advantages
here and there. The entire charge consumed
hardly more than an hour. Barlow, of Hancock's corps,
drove through a very strong line, and at five o'clock
reported that he had taken intrenchments with guns
and colors, but he could not stay there. An interior
breastwork commanded the one he had carried, and his
men had to withdraw, leaving behind them the captured
cannon, and bringing out a single Confederate standard
and two hundred and twenty prisoners as tokens of their
brief success. Wright and Smith succeeded in carrying
the first line of rifle-pits, but could get no farther
to the front. All our forces held ground close up to
the enemy. At some points they were intrenched within
a hundred feet of the rebel breastworks. Burnside, on
the right, captured some rifle-pits. Later he was attacked
by Early, who was roughly handled and repulsed.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span>
Warren was active, and repulsed a vigorous attack by
Gordon.</p>

<p>Thus by noon we had fully developed the Confederate
lines, and Grant could see what was necessary in
order to get through them. Hancock reported that in
his front it could not be done. Wright was decidedly
of the opinion that a lodgment could be made in his
front, but it would be difficult to make much by it unless
Hancock and Smith could also advance. Smith
thought he could carry the works before him, but was
not sanguine. Burnside also thought he could get
through, but Warren, who was nearest him, did not
seem to share his opinion. In this state of things, at
half past one o'clock, General Grant ordered the attack
to be suspended. He had told Meade as early as seven
in the morning to suspend the movement if it became
evident that success was impossible.</p>

<p>This was the battle of Cold Harbor, which has been
exaggerated into one of the bloodiest disasters of history,
a reckless, useless waste of human life. It was
nothing of the kind. The outlook warranted the effort.
The breaking of Lee's lines meant his destruction and
the collapse of the rebellion. Sheridan took the same
chances at Five Forks ten months later, and won; so
did Wright, Humphreys, Gibbon, and others at Petersburg.
They broke through far stronger lines than those
at Cold Harbor, and Lee fled in the night toward Appomattox.
So it would have been at Cold Harbor if
Grant had won, and who would have thought of the
losses?</p>

<p>While we lay at Cold Harbor, as when we had been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span>
at Spottsylvania, the principal topic of conversation was
the losses of the army. The discussion has never ceased.
There are still many persons who bitterly accuse Grant
of butchery in this campaign. As a matter of fact, Grant
lost fewer men in his successful effort to take Richmond
and end the war than his predecessors lost in making
the same attempt and failing. An official table, showing
the aggregate of the losses sustained by the armies of
McDowell, McClellan, Pope, Burnside, Hooker, Meade,
Butler, and Ord, in the effort to capture the Confederate
capital, is appended:</p>

<h3>THE MARCH ON PETERSBURG.</h3>

<div class='intro'>

<p>In camp at Cold Harbor&mdash;Grant's opinion of Lee&mdash;Trouble with newspaper
correspondents&mdash;Moving south of the James River&mdash;The
great pontoon bridge&mdash;The fighting of the colored troops&mdash;Failure
to take Petersburg at first attack&mdash;Lee loses Grant and Beauregard

<p>The affair of June 3d at Cold Harbor showed that
Lee was not to be driven from his position without a
great sacrifice of life. A left flank movement south of
the James River was accordingly decided upon by
Grant. This was no new idea; that eventuality had
been part of the original plan of campaign, and preparations
for bridging the James had been ordered as
early as the 15th of April, three weeks before the battle
of the Wilderness. One object of the movement across
the James was to cut off Richmond's line of supplies
from the south. But before this could be done another
matter had to be attended to.</p>

<p>In General Grant's plan of campaign the effectual
destruction of the Virginia Central Railroad was an indispensable
feature. In moving from Culpeper he had
expected that before reaching the Chickahominy he
would have a chance to crush Lee's army by fighting.
This would have allowed him an undisturbed opportunity
to destroy that road, as well as the Fredericks<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span>burg
road from the Chickahominy to the North Anna.
The expectation had been disappointed by Lee's success
in avoiding a decisive battle. Before moving farther
in accomplishing the great object of the campaign,
these roads must be so thoroughly destroyed that when
Richmond was cut off from other lines of communication
with the south the attempt to repair and use the
line through Gordonsville and Lynchburg would be
hopeless. The work was first to be attempted by Sheridan
with cavalry. If he was not able to complete it,
the whole army was to be swung around for the purpose,
even should it be necessary to abandon temporarily
our communications with White House.</p>

<p>This necessity, as well as that of making thorough
preparations for the difficult march south of the James
and for the perfect co-operation of Butler at Bermuda
Hundred, detained Grant at Cold Harbor until June
12th. Two officers of his staff, Colonel Comstock and
Colonel Porter, had been sent to General Butler to arrange
for co-operation in the movement of the army to
Bermuda Hundred, and to look over the ground to be
traversed and the means of crossing the river. Grant
would not order the movement until they returned.
They did not get back until the 12th.</p>

<p>During this time the opposing lines of Grant and
Lee were very close together, and on our side the troops
made regular siege approaches to the Confederate
works. The days passed quietly, with no fighting except
an occasional rattle of musketry and now and then
a cannon shot. There was occasionally a scare on the
line. On the evening of June 5th Wright's and Han<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span>cock's
line responded to a stiff assault; the firing lasted
for twenty minutes, and it was very loud, but it was
all about nothing and no harm was done. The enemy
were so near that in the dark our men thought they
were coming out to attack. On June 6th there was an
onslaught on Burnside just after midnight, which was
successfully repulsed, and in the afternoon a rush was
made by a party of a hundred picked men of the enemy,
who came to find out what was the meaning of Hancock's
advancing siege lines. As a rule, everything was
quiet except the picket firing, which could not be prevented
when the men were so close together. The
picket firing ceased only during the occasional truces
to bury the dead.</p>

<p>The operations around Cold Harbor, the close proximity
of the two lines, the unceasing firing, with no hour
in the day or night when one could not hear the sound
of musketry and cannon, were precisely like the conditions
at Spottsylvania and those on the North Anna.
It was a constant feeling for the weak spot in Lee's
armor. There was far less maneuvering at Cold Harbor
after the first efforts than during the long struggle
at Spottsylvania. We were merely waiting for the
proper moment to withdraw toward the James. Grant,
Meade, and all the leading officers were certain of ultimate
success; although the fighting had been more severe
and continuous than anything in the previous history
of the army, I must say a cheerful, confident tone
generally prevailed. All acted as if they were at a job
which required only time to finish.</p>

<p>Grant was disappointed, and talked to me a good<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span>
deal about the failure to get at Lee in an open battle
which would wind up the Confederacy. The general
was constantly revolving plans to turn Lee out of his
intrenchments. The old-time fear of Lee's superior
ability that was rife among the officers of the Army of
the Potomac had entirely disappeared. They had begun
to look upon him as an ordinary mortal, making a fairly
good effort to ward off fate, and nothing more. I think
Grant respected Lee's military ability and character, yet
the boldness with which he maneuvered in Lee's presence
is proof that he was not overawed by Lee's prestige
as a strategist and tactician. He thought Lee's
great forte was as a defensive fighter, a quality displayed
at Antietam and Fredericksburg; but held no high
opinion of his Chancellorsville operations, where he had
recklessly laid himself open to ruin. To me the views
of the military men at the different headquarters were
interesting and instructive.</p>

<p>While we were encamped at Cold Harbor, General
Meade was very much disturbed by a letter published
in a Cincinnati paper, saying that after the battle of
the Wilderness he counselled retreat&mdash;a course which
would have destroyed the nation, but which Grant prohibited.
This was entirely untrue. Meade had not
shown any weakness since moving from Culpeper, nor
once intimated doubt as to the successful issue of the
campaign. Nor had he intimated that any other plan
or line would be more likely to win. The newspaper
correspondent who was responsible for the misstatement
was with us, and Meade ordered that, as a punishment,
he should be paraded through the lines and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span>
afterward expelled from the army. This was done on
June 8th, the correspondent being led through the army
on horseback by the provost-marshal guard. On his
back and breast were tacked placards inscribed, "Libeller
of the Press."</p>

<p>It was not often, considering the conditions, that
correspondents got into trouble in the army. As a rule,
they were discreet. Besides this case of Meade, I remember
now only one other in which I was actively
interested; that was a few months later, after I had returned
to the department. Mr. Stanton had been
annoyed by a telegram which had been published about
Sherman's movements, and he ordered me to send it
to the general, so that we might know how much truth
there was in it. I wired him as follows:</p>

<div class='letter'>

<p class='nr5right'>
<span class="smcap">War Department</span>, <i class='date'>November 9, 1864</i>.</p>

</p>

<p>"Yesterday's Indianapolis Journal says: 'Officers
from Chattanooga report that Sherman returned to Atlanta
early last week with five corps of his army, leaving
two corps in Tennessee to watch Hood. He destroyed
the railroad from Chattanooga to Atlanta, and

burned, and Sherman is now marching for Charleston,
S.C.'"</p></div>

<p>Sherman sent back two characteristic dispatches.
The first ran:</p>

<div class='letter'>

<p class='nr5right'>
<span class="smcap">Kingston, Ga.</span>, <i class='date'>November 10, 1864</i>.</p>

<p class='nr5right'>
<span class="smcap">W. T. Sherman</span>, <i class='title'>Major General</i>.
</p></div>

<p>The second:</p>

<div class='letter'>

<p class='nr5right'>
<span class="smcap">Kingston, Ga.</span>, <i class='date'>November 10, 1864</i>.</p>

<p>Hon. <span class="smcap">C. A. Dana</span>, Assistant Secretary of War:
</p>

<p>If indiscreet newspaper men publish information too
near the truth, counteract its effect by publishing other
paragraphs calculated to mislead the enemy, such as
"Sherman's army has been re-enforced, especially in
the cavalry, and he will soon move several columns in
circuit, so as to catch Hood's army"; "Sherman's destination
is not Charleston, but Selma, where he will
meet an army from the Gulf," etc.</p>

<p class='nr5right'>
<span class="smcap">W. T. Sherman</span>, <i class='title'>Major General</i>.
</p></div>

<p>So I telegraphed to Indianapolis to General A. P.
Hovey, who was stationed there:</p>

<div class='letter'>

<p class='nr5right'>
<span class="smcap">War Department</span>, <i class='date'>November 10, 1864</i>.</p>

<p>Major-General <span class="smcap">A. P. Hovey</span>, Indianapolis:
</p>

<p>In compliance with the request of Major-General
Sherman, the Secretary of War directs that you ascertain
what persons furnished the information respecting
Sherman's alleged movement published in the Indianapolis
Journal of the 8th inst. You will arrest them
and send them under guard to such point in the Department
of the Cumberland as Major-General Thomas may
prefer, where they will be employed in hard labor upon
the fortifications until General Sherman shall otherwise
order.</p></div>

<p>General Hovey never found the man, however.</p>

<p>By the morning of the 12th of June Grant was ready
for his last flank movement of the campaign. Our
army at that time, including Sheridan's cavalry, con<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span>sisted
of approximately one hundred and fifteen thousand
fighting men. The plan for moving this great
body was as follows: The Eighteenth Corps was to
move to White House without baggage or artillery,
and there embark for City Point. The Fifth Corps was
to cross the Chickahominy at Long Bridge, and take a
position to secure the passage of the remainder of the
army, after which it was to cover the rear. The Second,
Sixth, and Ninth Corps were to cross in two columns at
Long Bridge and Jones's Bridge. At first it had been
hoped, if not opposed by the enemy in force, to strike
James River immediately opposite Bermuda Hundred;
if resisted, then lower down, where General Butler had
been ordered to throw a bridge across and to corduroy
the approaches.</p>

<p>The Fifth Corps having prepared the way, the whole
army left the lines about Cold Harbor on schedule time,
just as soon after nightfall on the 12th as its movements
could be concealed from the observation of the enemy.
It was in drawing orders for such complicated movements
as these, along different roads and by different
crossings, that the ability of General Humphreys, the
chief of staff, was displayed. Everything went perfectly
from the start. That evening at seven o'clock, when I
reached Moody's, four miles from Long Bridge, the
Fifth Corps (Warren's) was moving rapidly past us.
Our cavalry advance, under General Wilson, who had
also been transferred to the East, had previously taken
Long Bridge and laid a pontoon bridge in readiness for
the crossing, so that by nine o'clock that evening the
Fifth Corps was south of the Chickahominy, well out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span>
toward the approaches from Richmond, and covering
them. All day, the 13th, the army was hurrying toward
the James. By night the Sixth Corps had reached the
river, and the rest of the troops were on the march
between there and the Chickahominy, which was our
rear.</p>

<p>When I reached the James early the next day, the
14th, large numbers of men were hard at work on the
pontoon bridge and its approaches, by which it was
intended that the artillery and trains should cross. It
was a pretty heavy job to corduroy the marsh, which
was fully half a mile wide and quite deep. The bridge
itself was unprecedented in military annals, except,
perhaps, by that of Xerxes, being nearly seven hundred
yards long.</p>

<p>All day on the 14th everything went like a miracle.
The pontoon bridge was finished at two o'clock the next
morning, and the cavalry of Wilson's leading brigade,
followed by the artillery trains, instantly began crossing.
By ten o'clock on the 15th Hancock's corps had
been ferried over, and he was off toward Petersburg to
support Smith, who had taken the Eighteenth Corps
around by water from the White House, and had been
ordered to attack Petersburg that morning. All the
news we had that night at City Point, where headquarters
had been set up, was that Smith had assaulted and
carried the principal line of the enemy before Petersburg.</p>

<p>The next morning early I was off for the heights
southeast of the town. Smith's success appeared to be
of the most important kind. He had carried heights<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span>
which were defended by very formidable works. He
thought&mdash;and, indeed, we all thought for the moment&mdash;that
his success gave us perfect command of the city
and railroad. I went over the conquered lines with
General Grant and the engineer officers, and they all
agreed that the works were of the very strongest kind,
more difficult even to take than Missionary Ridge at
Chattanooga.</p>

<p>General Smith told us that the negro troops fought
magnificently, the hardest fighting being done by them.
The forts they stormed were, I think, the worst of all.
After the affair was over, General Smith went to thank
them, and tell them he was proud of their courage and
dash. He said they had no superiors as soldiers, and
that hereafter he should send them into a difficult place
as readily as the best white troops. They captured six
out of the sixteen cannons which he took.</p>

<p>It soon appeared, however, that Smith was far from
having captured points which commanded Petersburg.
His success had but little effect in determining the final
result. He had stopped his advance a few minutes and
a considerable space too soon, because, as he subsequently
alleged, it was too dark and his men were too
much fatigued for further operations; and he feared Lee
had already re-enforced the town. This turned out not
to be so; Lee did not know until the 17th that Grant
had crossed the James. And up to that date Lee's position
was a mystery to us; we could hardly suppose he
had remained at Cold Harbor.</p>

<p>When Grant discovered exactly how much had been
gained and lost, he was very much dissatisfied. There<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span>
was a controversy between Hancock and Smith subsequently
about the responsibility for this failure.</p>

<p>On June 16th, the day after Smith's attack, more of
the troops arrived before Petersburg. General Meade
also arrived on the ground, and the job of capturing
Petersburg was now taken up in earnest by the whole
Army of the Potomac. It was no longer a mere matter
of advancing eighty or one hundred rods, as on the
night previous, for meanwhile the enemy had been
largely and rapidly re-enforced. Much time and
many thousands of valuable lives were to be expended
in getting possession of this vital point, which had
really been in our grasp on the evening of the 15th.
That afternoon there began a series of assaults
on the works of the enemy. The fighting lasted all
night, the moonlight being very clear. Our loss was
heavy.</p>

<p>The next day, the 17th, another attack was made
at Petersburg. It was persistent, but Meade found that
his men were so worn out with marching, fighting, and
digging that they must have rest, and so laid off until
noon of the 18th, when, all of the army being up, a general
assault was ordered. Nothing important was
gained, and General Grant directed that no more assaults
should be made. He said that after this he should
maneuver to get possession of Petersburg.</p>

<p>I saw nothing of the fighting of June 16th and 17th,
being ill in camp, but the members of Grant's staff told
me that our operations were unsatisfactory, owing to
our previous heavy loss in superior officers. The men
fought as well as ever, Colonel Comstock told me, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span>
they were not directed with the same skill and enthusiasm.</p>

<p>While these operations were going on, I made two
or three trips to the river to watch the crossing of the
troops. It was an animated and inspiring sight, for
the great mass of men, animals, and baggage was
handled with the greatest intelligence. By the 17th our
entire army was south of the James, and the bridge
over the river by which the trains had crossed was
taken up.</p>

<p>During all this period, from Cold Harbor to Petersburg,
we knew nothing of Lee. In making the disposition
for this great and successful movement&mdash;a far more
brilliant evolution than McClellan's "change of base"
two years before over almost the same roads&mdash;the purpose
was, of course, to deceive Lee as to the ultimate
direction of the army. The design succeeded far beyond
Grant's most sanguine hopes. As soon, on the
morning of the 13th, as the Confederate chieftain discovered
our withdrawal, he moved his army across the
Chickahominy in hot haste, flinging it between his capital
and the foe, supposed to be advancing on a new line
between the James and the Chickahominy. He held
and fortified a line from White Oak swamp to Malvern
Hill, and here he remained stock still for four days, wondering
what had become of Grant.</p>

<p class='p2'>Lee had been completely deceived, and could not
be made to believe by Beauregard, on the 15th, 16th,
and 17th, that Grant's whole army had turned up before
Petersburg. His troops, as we know now, did not
cross the James, to go to the relief of Beauregard until<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span>
the 17th. He was caught napping, and, but for mistakes
by subordinates in carrying out Grant's plans, Lee's
cause would have been lost. In the operations from the
night of the 12th, when Grant changed his line and base
with an army of one hundred and fifteen thousand men,
and all its vast trains of artillery, crossing a wide and
deep river on a temporary bridge, until June 18th, when
at last Lee awoke to the situation, General Beauregard
shines out on the Confederate side far more brilliantly
than the general in chief. He unquestionably saved
Petersburg, and for the time the Confederacy; but for
him Lee had at that time lost the game.</p>

<h3>EARLY'S RAID AND THE WASHINGTON PANIC.</h3>

<div class='intro'>

<p>President Lincoln visits the lines at Petersburg&mdash;Trouble with General
Meade&mdash;Jubal Early menaces the Federal capital&mdash;The excitement
in Washington and Baltimore&mdash;Clerks and veteran reserves called
out to defend Washington&mdash;Grant sends troops from the front&mdash;Plenty
of generals, but no head&mdash;Early ends the panic by withdrawing&mdash;A
fine letter from Grant about Hunter.</p></div>


<p>Although Grant had decided against a further direct
attack on the works of Petersburg, he was by no
means idle. He sent out expeditions to break up the
railroads leading into the town. He began extending
his lines around to the south and southwest, so as to
make the investment as complete as possible. Batteries
were put in place, weak spots in the fortifications were
felt for, and regular siege works were begun. Indeed,
by July 1st the general opinion seemed to be that the
only way we should ever gain Petersburg would be by
a systematic siege.</p>

<p>A few days later we had an interesting visit from
President Lincoln, who arrived from Washington on
June 21st, and at once wanted to visit the lines before
Petersburg. General Grant, Admiral Lee, myself, and
several others went with him. I remember that, as we
passed along the lines, Mr. Lincoln's high hat was
brushed off by the branch of a tree. There were a dozen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span>
young officers whose duty it was to get it and give it
back to the President; but Admiral Lee was off his
horse before any of these young chaps, and recovered
the hat for the President. Admiral Lee must have been
forty-five or fifty years old. It was his agility that impressed
me so much.</p>

<p>As we came back we passed through the division of
colored troops which had so greatly distinguished itself
under Smith on the 15th. They were drawn up in
double lines on each side of the road, and they welcomed
the President with hearty shouts. It was a memorable
thing to behold him whose fortune it was to
represent the principle of emancipation passing bareheaded
through the enthusiastic ranks of those negroes
armed to defend the integrity of the nation.</p>

<p>I went back to Washington with the presidential
party, but remained only a few days, as Mr. Lincoln
and Mr. Stanton were anxious for my daily reports of
the operations around Petersburg. On the return, I arrived
at City Point on July 1st. The army occupied
about the same positions as when I had left it a week
before. Two corps were engaged in siege work, their
effort being to get possession of a ridge before them,
supposed to command Petersburg; if they succeeded in
this, Grant thought that the enemy would have to abandon
the south side of the Appomattox, and, of course,
the town. On the left our line extended southward
and westward across what was known as the Jerusalem
road, but at so great a distance from the Confederate
fortifications as to have no immediate effect upon them.
Farther around to the west, toward the Appomattox<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span>
above Petersburg, the enemy's works extended, and
the idea of enveloping them for the whole distance
had been given up. The efforts to break up the railroads
leading from Petersburg had been very successful,
Grant told me. There were plans for assault
suggested, but Grant had not considered any of them
seriously.</p>

<p>Before the army had recovered from its long march
from Cold Harbor and the failure to capture the town,
there was an unusual amount of controversy going on
among the officers. Smith was berated generally for
failing to complete his attack of June 15th. Butler
and "Baldy" Smith were deep in a controversial correspondence;
and Meade and Warren were so at loggerheads
that Meade notified Warren that he must
either ask to be relieved as corps commander or he
(Meade) would prefer charges against him. It seemed
as if Meade grew more unpopular every day. Finally
the difficulties between him and his subordinates became
so serious that a change in the commander of the
Army of the Potomac seemed probable. Grant had
great confidence in Meade, and was much attached to
him personally; but the almost universal dislike of Meade
which prevailed among officers of every rank who came
in contact with him, and the difficulty of doing business
with him, felt by every one except Grant himself, so
greatly impaired his capacities for usefulness and rendered
success under his command so doubtful that Grant
seemed to be coming to the conviction that he must be
relieved.</p>

<p>I had long known Meade to be a man of the worst<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span>
possible temper, especially toward his subordinates. I
think he had not a friend in the whole army. No man,
no matter what his business or his service, approached
him without being insulted in one way or another, and
his own staff officers did not dare to speak to him unless
first spoken to, for fear of either sneers or curses.
The latter, however, I had never heard him indulge in
very violently, but he was said to apply them often
without occasion and without reason. At the same
time, as far as I was able to ascertain, his generals had
lost their confidence in him as a commander. His orders
for the last series of assaults upon Petersburg, in
which we lost ten thousand men without gaining any
decisive advantage, were greatly criticised. They were,
in effect, that he had found it impracticable to secure
the co-operation of corps commanders, and that, therefore,
each one was to attack on his own account and
do the best he could by himself. The consequence was
that each gained some advantage of position, but each
exhausted his own strength in so doing; while, for the
want of a general purpose and a general commander to
direct and concentrate the whole, it all amounted to
nothing but heavy loss to ourselves. General Wright
remarked confidentially to a friend that all of Meade's
attacks had been made without brains and without generalship.</p>

<p>The first week of July the subject came to pretty
full discussion at Grant's headquarters on account of an
extraordinary correspondence between Meade and Wilson.
The Richmond Examiner had charged Wilson's
command with stealing not only negroes and horses,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span>
but silver plate and clothing on a raid he had just
made against the Danville and Southside Railroad, and
Meade, taking up the statement of the Examiner for
truth, read Wilson a lecture, and called on him for
explanations. Wilson denied the charge of robbing
women and churches, and said he hoped Meade would
not be ready to condemn his command because its
operations had excited the ire of the public enemy.
Meade replied that Wilson's explanation was satisfactory;
but this correspondence started a conversation
in which Grant expressed himself quite frankly
as to the general trouble with Meade, and his fear
that it would become necessary to relieve him. In
that event, he said, it would be necessary to put Hancock
in command.</p>

<p>In the first days of July we began to get inquiries
at City Point from Washington concerning the whereabouts
of the Confederate generals Early and Ewell. It
was reported in the capital, our dispatches said, that
they were moving down the Shenandoah Valley. We
seemed to have pretty good evidence that Early was
with Lee, defending Petersburg, and so I wired the
Secretary on July 3d. The next day we felt less positive.
A deserter came in on the morning of the 4th,
and said that it was reported in the enemy's camp that
Ewell had gone into Maryland with his entire corps.
Another twenty-four hours, and Meade told me that he
was at last convinced that Early and his troops had
gone down the valley. In fact, Early had been gone
three weeks. He left Lee's army near Cold Harbor on
the morning of the 13th of June, when we were on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span>
the march to the James. Hunter's defeat of Jones
near Staunton had forced Lee to divide his army in
order to stop Hunter's dangerous advance on Lynchburg.</p>

<p>On the 6th General Grant was convinced that Washington
was the objective. The raid threatened was sufficiently
serious to compel the sending of troops to the
defense of the capital, and a body of men immediately
embarked. Three days later I started myself to Washington,
in order to keep Grant informed of what was
going on. When I arrived, I found both Washington
and Baltimore in a state of great excitement; both
cities were filled with people who had fled from the
enemy. The damage to private property done by
the invaders was said to be almost beyond calculation.
Mills, workshops, and factories of every sort
were reported as destroyed, and from twenty-five
to fifty miles of the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad
torn up.</p>

<p>During my first day in town, July 11th, all sorts
of rumors came in. General Lew Wallace, then in command
at Baltimore, sent word that a large force of the
enemy had been seen that morning near that city. The
Confederate generals were said to have dined together
at Rockville a day or two before. The houses of Governor
Bradford, Francis P. Blair, senior, and his son,
Montgomery, the Postmaster General, were reported
burned. We could see from Washington clouds of dust
in several quarters around the city, which we believed to
be raised by bodies of hostile cavalry. There was some
sharp skirmishing that day, too, on the Tennallytown<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span>
road, as well as later in front of Fort Stevens, and at
night the telegraph operators at the latter place reported
a considerable number of camp fires visible in front of
them.</p>

<p>I found that the Washington authorities had utilized
every man in town for defense. Some fifteen hundred
employees of the quartermaster's department had
been armed and sent out; the veteran reserves about
Washington and Alexandria had likewise been sent to
the front. General Augur, commanding the defenses
of Washington, had also drawn from the fortifications
on the south side of the town all the men that in his
judgment could possibly be spared. To this improvised
force were added that day some six boatloads of
troops which General Grant had sent from the Army
of the Potomac. These troops went at once to Fort
Stevens.</p>

<p>With the troops coming from Grant, there was force
enough to save the capital; but I soon saw that nothing
could possibly be done toward pursuing or cutting off
the enemy for want of a commander. General Hunter
and his forces had not yet returned from their swing
around the circle. General Augur commanded the defenses
of Washington, with A. McD. McCook and a lot
of brigadier generals under him, but he was not allowed
to go outside. Wright commanded only his own corps.
General Gilmore had been assigned to the temporary
command of those troops of the Nineteenth Corps just
arrived from New Orleans, and all other troops in the
Middle Department, leaving Wallace to command Baltimore
alone. But there was no head to the whole. Gen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span>eral Halleck
would not give orders, except as he received
them from Grant; the President would give
none; and, until Grant directed positively and explicitly
what was to be done, everything was practically at a
standstill. Things, I saw, would go on in the deplorable
and fatal way in which they had been going for a week.
Of course, this want of a head was causing a great deal
of sharp comment on all sides. Postmaster-General
Blair was particularly incensed, and, indeed, with real
cause, for he had lost his house at Silver Springs. Some
of his remarks reached General Halleck, who immediately
wrote to Mr. Stanton the following letter:</p>

<div class='letter'>

<p class='nr9right'>
<span class="smcap">Headquarters of the Army</span>,</p>
<p class='nr5right'><span class="smcap">Washington</span>, <i class='date'>July 13, 1864</i>.</p>

<p>Hon. <span class="smcap">E. M. Stanton</span>, Secretary of War.
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir</span>: I deem it my duty to bring to your notice the
following facts: I am informed by an officer of rank
and standing in the military service that the Hon. M.
Blair, Postmaster General, in speaking of the burning
of his house in Maryland this morning, said, in effect,
that the officers in command about Washington are
poltroons; that there were not more that five hundred
rebels on the Silver Springs road, and we had one million
of men in arms; that it was a disgrace; that General
Wallace was in comparison with them far better,
as he would at least fight. As there have been for the
last few days a large number of officers on duty in and
about Washington who have devoted their time and
energies, night and day, and have periled their lives in
the support of the Government, it is due to them, as
well as to the War Department, that it should be known
whether such wholesale denouncement and accusation
by a member of the Cabinet receives the sanction and
approbation of the President of the United States. If
so, the names of the officers accused should be stricken
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span>from the rolls of the army; if not, it is due to the honor
of the accused that the slanderer should be dismissed
from the Cabinet.</p>

<p class='nr3left'>Very respectfully, your obedient servant,</p>

<p class='nr9right'>
<span class="smcap">H. W. Halleck</span>,</p>
<p class='nr5right'>
<i class='title'>Major General and Chief of Staff</i>.
</p></div>

<p>The very day on which Halleck wrote this letter we
had evidence that the enemy had taken fright at the
arrival in Washington of the troops sent by Grant, and
were moving off toward Edwards Ferry. It was pretty
certain that they were carrying off a large amount of
cattle and other plunder with them. By the end of another
day there seemed no doubt that Early had got
the main body of his command across the river with his
captures. What they were, it was impossible to say
precisely. One herd of cattle was reported as containing
two thousand head, and the number of horses and
mules taken from Maryland was reported as about five
thousand. This, however, was probably somewhat exaggerated.</p>

<p>The veterans, of course, at once moved out to attempt
to overtake the enemy. The irregulars were
withdrawn from the fortifications, General Meigs marching
his division of quartermaster's clerks and employees
back to their desks; and Admiral Goldsborough, who
had marshalled the marines and sailors, returned to
smoke his pipe on his own doorstep.</p>

<p>The pursuit of Early proved, on the whole, an egregious
blunder, relieved only by a small success at Winchester
in which four guns and some prisoners were
captured. Wright accomplished nothing, and drew<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span>
back as soon as he got where he might have done something
worth while. As it was, Early escaped with the
whole of his plunder.</p>

<p>One of the best letters Grant sent me during the
war was at the time of this Early raid on Washington.
When the alarms of invasion first came, Grant ordered
Major-General David Hunter, then stationed at Parkersburg,
W. Va., to take the direction of operations
against the enemy's forces in the valley. Hunter did
not come up to Mr. Stanton's expectations in this crisis,
and when I reached Washington the Secretary told me
to telegraph Grant that, in his opinion, Hunter ought
to be removed. Three days later I repeated in my dispatch
to Grant certain rumors about Hunter that had
reached the War Department. The substance of them
was that Hunter had been engaged in an active campaign
against the newspapers in West Virginia, and
that he had horsewhipped a soldier with his own hand.
I received an immediate reply:</p>

<div class='letter'>

<p class='nr5right'>

<span class="smcap">City Point, Va.</span>, <i class='date'>July 15, 1864</i>&mdash;8 <small>P.M.</small></p>
<p>
<span class="smcap">C. A. Dana</span>, Assistant Secretary of War:<br />
</p>

<p>I am sorry to see such a disposition to condemn so
brave an old soldier as General Hunter is known to be
without a hearing. He is known to have advanced into
the enemy's country toward their main army, inflicting
a much greater damage upon them than they have inflicted
upon us with double his force, and moving directly
away from our main army. Hunter acted, too,
in a country where we had no friends, while the enemy
have only operated in territory where, to say the least,
many of the inhabitants are their friends. If General
Hunter has made war upon the newspapers in West
Virginia, probably he has done right. In horsewhip<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span>ping
a soldier he has laid himself subject to trial, but
nine chances out of ten he only acted on the spur of
the moment, under great provocation. I fail to see yet
that General Hunter has not acted with great promptness
and great success. Even the enemy give him
great credit for courage, and congratulate themselves
that he will give them a chance of getting even with him.</p>

<h3>THE SECRET SERVICE OF THE WAR.</h3>

<div class='intro'>

<p>Mr. Stanton's agents and spies&mdash;Regular subterranean traffic between
Washington and Richmond&mdash;A man who spied for both sides&mdash;The
arrest of the Baltimore merchants&mdash;Stanton's remarkable speech
on the meaning of disloyalty&mdash;Intercepting Jefferson Davis's letters
to Canada&mdash;Detecting the plot to burn New York, and the
plan to invade Vermont&mdash;Story of the cleverest and pluckiest of
spies and his remarkable adventures.</p></div>


<p>After Early's invaders had retired and quiet was
restored, I went to Mr. Stanton for new orders. As
there was no probability of an immediate change in the
situation before Petersburg, the Secretary did not think
it necessary for me to go back to Grant, but preferred
that I remain in the department, helping with the routine
work.</p>

<p>Much of my time at this period was spent in investigating
charges against defaulting contractors and dishonest
agents, and in ordering arrests of persons suspected
of disloyalty to the Government. I assisted,
too, in supervising the spies who were going back and
forth between the lines. Among these I remember
one, a sort of peddler&mdash;whose name I will call Morse&mdash;who
traveled between Washington and Richmond.
When he went down it was in the character of a man
who had entirely hoodwinked the Washington authori<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span>ties,
and who, in spite of them, or by some corruption
or other, always brought with him into the Confederate
lines something that the people wanted&mdash;dresses for the
ladies or some little luxury that they couldn't get otherwise.
The things that he took with him were always
supervised by our agents before he went away. When
he came back he brought us in exchange a lot of valuable
information. He was doubtless a spy on both
sides; but as we got a great deal of information, which
could be had in no other way, about the strength of the
Confederate armies, and the preparations and the movements
of the enemy, we allowed the thing to go on.
The man really did good service for us that summer,
and, as we were frequently able to verify by other means
the important information he brought, we had a great
deal of confidence in him.</p>

<p>Early in October, 1864, he came back from Richmond,
and, as usual, went to Baltimore to get his outfit
for the return trip. When he presented himself again
in Washington, the chief detective of the War Department,
Colonel Baker, examined his goods carefully, but
this time he found that Morse had many things that
we could not allow him to take. Among his stuff were
uniforms and other military goods, and all this, of
course, was altogether too contraband to be passed.
We had all his bills, telling where he had bought these
things in Baltimore. They amounted to perhaps
twenty-five thousand dollars, or more. So we confiscated
the contraband goods, and put Morse in prison.</p>

<p>But the merchants in Baltimore were partners in
his guilt, and Secretary Stanton declared he would ar<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</a></span>rest
every one of them and put them in prison until the
affair could be straightened up. He turned the matter
over to me then, as he was going to Fort Monroe for
a few days. I immediately sent Assistant-Adjutant-General
Lawrence to Baltimore with orders to see that all
persons implicated were arrested. Lawrence telegraphed
me, on October 16th, that the case would involve
the arrest of two hundred citizens. I reported
to the Secretary, but he was determined to go ahead.
The next morning ninety-seven of the leading citizens
of Baltimore were arrested, brought to Washington,
and confined in Old Capitol Prison, principally in solitary
cells. There was great satisfaction among the
Union people of the town, but great indignation among
Southern sympathizers. Presently a deputation from
Baltimore came over to see President Lincoln. It was
an outrage, they said; the gentlemen arrested were
most respectable merchants and faultless citizens, and
they demanded that they all be set instantly at liberty
and damages paid them. Mr. Lincoln sent the deputation
over to the War Department, and Mr. Stanton,
who had returned by this time, sent for me. "All Baltimore
is coming here," he said. "Sit down and hear
the discussion."</p>

<p>They came in, the bank presidents and boss merchants
of Baltimore&mdash;there must have been at least fifty
million dollars represented in the deputation&mdash;and sat
down around the fire in the Secretary's office. Presently
they began to make their speeches, detailing the circumstances
and the wickedness of this outrage. There
was no ground for it, they said, no justification. After<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</a></span>
half a dozen of them had spoken, Mr. Stanton asked one
after another if he had anything more to say, and they
all said no. Then Stanton began, and delivered one of
the most eloquent speeches that I ever heard. He described
the beginning of the war, for which, he said,
there was no justification; being beaten in an election
was no reason for destroying the Government. Then
he went on to the fact that half a million of our young
men had been laid in untimely graves by this conspiracy
of the slave interest. He outlined the whole conspiracy
in the most solemn and impressive terms, and then he
depicted the offense that this man Morse, aided by these
several merchants, had committed. "Gentlemen," he
said, "if you would like to examine the bills of what
he was taking to the enemy, here they are."</p>

<p>When Stanton had finished, these gentlemen, without
answering a word, got up and one by one went
away. That was the only speech I ever listened to that
cleared out the entire audience.</p>

<p>Early in the winter of 1863-'64 a curious thing happened
in the secret service of the War Department.
Some time in the February or March before, a slender
and prepossessing young fellow, between twenty-two
and twenty-six apparently, had applied at the War Department
for employment as a spy within the Confederate
lines.</p>

<p>The main body of the Army of Northern Virginia
was then lying at Gordonsville, and the headquarters of
the Army of the Potomac were at Culpeper Courthouse.
General Grant had not yet come from the West to take
command of the momentous campaign which afterward<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</a></span>
opened with his movement into the Wilderness on the
5th of May.</p>

<p>The young man who sought this terrible service
was well dressed and intelligent, and professed to be
animated by motives purely patriotic. He was a clerk
in one of the departments. All that he asked was that
he should have a horse and an order which would carry
him safely through the Federal lines, and, in return, he
undertook to bring information from General Lee's
army and from the Government of the Confederacy in
Richmond. He understood perfectly the perilous nature
of the enterprise he proposed.</p>

<p>Finding that the applicant bore a good character
in the office where he was employed, it was determined
to accept his proposal. He was furnished with a horse,
an order that would pass him through the Union lines,
and also, I believe, with a moderate sum of money, and
then he departed. Two or three weeks later he reported
at the War Department. He had been in Gordonsville
and Richmond, had obtained the confidence of the Confederate
authorities, and was the bearer of a letter from
Mr. Jefferson Davis to Mr. Clement C. Clay, the agent
of the Confederate Government in Canada, then known
to be stationed at St. Catherine's, not far from Niagara
Falls. Mr. Clay had as his official associate Jacob
Thompson, of Mississippi, who had been Secretary of
the Interior in the Cabinet of President Buchanan, and,
like Mr. Clay, had been serving the Confederate Government
ever since its organization.</p>

<p>The letter from Mr. Davis the young man exhibited,
but only the outside of the envelope was examined.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span>
The address was in the handwriting of the Confederate
chief, and the statement of our young adventurer that
it was merely a letter of recommendation advising
Messrs. Clay and Thompson that they might repose
confidence in the bearer, since he was ardently devoted
to the Confederate cause and anxious to serve
the great purpose that it had in view, appeared entirely
probable; so the young man was allowed to
proceed to Niagara Falls and Canada. He made some
general report upon the condition of the rebel army at
Gordonsville, but it was of no particular value, except
that in its more interesting features it agreed with
our information from other sources.</p>

<p>Our spy was not long in returning from St. Catherine's
with a dispatch which was also allowed to pass
unopened, upon his assurance that it contained nothing
of importance. In this way he went back and forward
from Richmond to St. Catherine's once or twice. We
supplied him with money to a limited extent, and also
with one or two more horses. He said that he got
some money from the Confederates, but had not
thought it prudent to accept from them anything more
than very small sums, since his professed zeal for the
Confederate cause forbade his receiving anything for
his traveling expenses beyond what was absolutely
necessary.</p>

<p>During the summer of 1864 the activity of Grant's
campaign, and the fighting which prevailed all along
the line, somewhat impeded our young man's expeditions,
but did not stop them. All his subsequent dispatches,
however, whether coming from Richmond or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span>
from Canada, were regularly brought to the War Department,
and were opened, and in every case a copy
of them was kept. As it was necessary to break the
seals and destroy the envelopes in opening them, there
was some difficulty in sending them forward in what
should appear to be the original wrappers. Coming
from Canada, the paper employed was English, and
there was a good deal of trouble in procuring paper
of the same appearance. I remember also that one important
dispatch, which was sealed with Mr. Clay's seal,
had to be delayed somewhat while we had an imitation
seal engraved. But these delays were easily accounted
for at Richmond by the pretense that they had been
caused by accidents upon the road and by the necessity
of avoiding the Federal pickets. At any rate, the
confidence of the Confederates in our agent and in
theirs never seemed to be shaken by any of these
occurrences.</p>

<p>Finally our dispatch bearer reported one day at the
War Department with a document which, he said, was
of extraordinary consequence. It was found to contain
an account of a scheme for setting fire to New York
and Chicago by means of clock-work machines that were
to be placed in several of the large hotels and places of
amusement&mdash;particularly in Barnum's Museum in New
York&mdash;and to be set off simultaneously, so that the fire
department in each place would be unable to attend
to the great number of calls that would be made upon
it on account of these Confederate conflagrations in
so many different quarters, and thus these cities might
be greatly damaged, or even destroyed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span></p>

<p>This dispatch was duly sealed up again and was
taken to Richmond, and a confidential officer was at
once sent to New York to warn General Dix, who was
in command there, of the Confederate project. The
general was very unwilling to believe that any such
design could be seriously entertained, and Mr. John A.
Kennedy, then superintendent of police, was equally incredulous.
But the Secretary of War was peremptory
in his orders, and when the day of the incendiary attempt
arrived both the military and the police made
every preparation to prevent the threatened catastrophe.
The officer who went from Washington was
lodged in the St. Nicholas Hotel, one of the large establishments
that were to be set on fire, and while he was
washing his hands in the evening, preparatory to going
to dinner, a fire began burning in the room next to his.
It was promptly put out, and was found to be caused
by a clock-work apparatus which had been left in that
room by a lodger who had departed some hours before.
Other fires likewise occurred. In every instance these
fires were extinguished without much damage and without
exciting any considerable public attention, thanks
to the precautions that had been taken in consequence
of the warning derived from Mr. Clay's dispatch to Mr.
Benjamin in Richmond. The plan of setting fire to
Chicago proved even more abortive; I do not remember
that any report of actual burning was received from
there.</p>

<p>Later in the fall, after the military operations had
substantially terminated for the season, a dispatch was
brought from Canada, signed by Mr. Clay, and addressed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</a></span>
to Mr. Benjamin, as Secretary of State in the Confederate
Government, conveying the information that a
new and really formidable military expedition against
northern Vermont&mdash;particularly against Burlington, if
I am not mistaken&mdash;had been organized and fitted out
in Canada, and would make its attack as soon as practicable.
This was after the well-known attempt upon
St. Albans and Lake Champlain, on October 19, 1864,
and promised to be much more injurious. The dispatch
reached Washington one Sunday morning, and was
brought to the War Department as usual, but its importance
in the eyes of the Confederate agents had led
to its being prepared for transportation with uncommon
care. It was placed between two thicknesses of the pair
of re-enforced cavalry trousers which the messenger
wore, and sewed up so that when he was mounted it was
held between his thigh and the saddle.</p>

<p>Having been carefully ripped out and opened, it was
immediately carried to Mr. Stanton, who was confined
to his house by a cold. He read it. "This is serious,"
he said. "Go over to the White House and ask the
President to come here." Mr. Lincoln was found dressing
to go to church, and he was soon driven to Mr.
Stanton's house. After discussing the subject in every
aspect, and considering thoroughly the probability that
to keep the dispatch would put an end to communications
by this channel, they determined that it must be
kept. The conclusive reason for this step was that it
established beyond question the fact that the Confederates,
while sheltering themselves behind the British
Government in Canada, had organized and fitted out a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</a></span>
military expedition against the United States. But
while the dispatch afforded evidence that could not be
gainsaid, the mere possession of it was not sufficient.
It must be found in the possession of the Confederate
dispatch bearer, and the circumstances attending its
capture must be established in such a manner that the
British Foreign Office would not be able to dispute the
genuineness of the document. "We must have this
paper for Seward," said Mr. Lincoln. "As for the
young man, get him out of the scrape if you can."</p>

<p>Accordingly, the paper was taken back to the War
Department and sewed up again in the trousers whence
it had been taken three hours before. The bearer was
instructed to start at dusk on the road which he usually
took in passing through the lines, to be at a certain
tavern outside of Alexandria at nine o'clock in the
evening, and to stop there to water his horse. Then
information was sent through Major-General Augur,
commandant of Washington and the surrounding region,
to Colonel Henry H. Wells, then provost marshal
general of the defenses south of the Potomac, stationed
at Alexandria, directing him to be at this tavern at
nine o'clock in the evening, and to arrest a Confederate
dispatch bearer, concerning whom authentic information
had been received at the War Department, and
whose description was furnished for his (Wells's) guidance.
He was to do the messenger no injury, but to
make sure of his person and of all papers that he might
have upon him, and to bring him under a sufficient
guard directly to the War Department. And General
Augur was directed to be present there, in order to as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</a></span>sist
in the examination of the prisoner, and to verify
any dispatches that might be found.</p>

<p>Just before midnight a carriage drove up to the
door of the War Department with a soldier on the box
and two soldiers on the front seat within, while the back
seat was occupied by Colonel Wells and the prisoner.
Of course, no one but the two or three who had been
in the secret was aware that this gentleman had walked
quietly out of the War Department only a few hours
previously, and that the paper which was the cause of
the entire ceremony had been sewed up in his clothes
just before his departure. Colonel Wells reported that,
while the prisoner had offered no resistance, he was very
violent and outrageous in his language, and that he
boasted fiercely of his devotion to the Confederacy and
his detestation of the Union. During the examination
which now followed he said nothing except to answer
a few questions, but his bearing&mdash;patient, scornful, undaunted&mdash;was
that of an incomparable actor. If Mr.
Clay and Mr. Benjamin had been present, they would
have been more than ever certain that he was one of
their noblest young men. His hat, boots, and other
articles of his clothing were taken off one by one. The
hat and boots were first searched, and finally the dispatch
was found in his trousers and taken out. Its nature
and the method of its capture were stated in a
memorandum which was drawn up on the spot and
signed by General Augur and Colonel Wells and one
or two other officers who were there for the purpose,
and then the dispatch bearer himself was sent off to the
Old Capitol Prison.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</a></span></p>

<p>The dispatch, with the documents of verification,
was handed over to Mr. Seward for use in London,
and a day or two afterward the warden of the Old
Capitol Prison was directed to give the dispatch
bearer an opportunity of escaping, with a proper
show of attempted prevention. One afternoon the
spy walked into my office. "Ah!" said I, "you have
run away."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," he answered.</p>

<p>"Did they shoot at you?"</p>

<p>"They did, and didn't hit me; but I didn't think
that would answer the purpose. So I shot myself
through the arm."</p>

<p>He showed me the wound. It was through the fleshy
part of the forearm, and due care had been taken not
to break any bones. A more deliberate and less dangerous
wound could not be, and yet it did not look
trivial.</p>

<p>He was ordered to get away to Canada as promptly
as possible, so that he might explain the loss of his
dispatch before it should become known there by any
other means. An advertisement offering two thousand
dollars for his recapture was at once inserted in the
New York Herald, the Pittsburgh Journal, and the
Chicago Tribune. No one ever appeared to claim the
reward, but in about a week the escaped prisoner returned
from Canada with new dispatches that had been
entrusted to him. They contained nothing of importance,
however. The wound in his arm had borne testimony
in his favor, and the fact that he had hurried
through to St. Catherine's without having it dressed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</a></span>
was thought to afford conclusive evidence of his fidelity
to the Confederate cause.</p>

<p class='p2'>The war was ended soon after this adventure, and,
as his services had been of very great value, a new place,
with the assurance of lasting employment, was found
for the young man in one of the bureaus of the War
Department. He did not remain there very long, however,
and I don't know what became of him. He was
one of the cleverest creatures I ever saw. His style of
patriotic lying was sublime; it amounted to genius.</p>

<h3>A VISIT TO SHERIDAN IN THE VALLEY.</h3>

<div class='intro'>

<p>It was just after the arrest of the Baltimore merchants,
in October, 1864, that I visited Sheridan at his
headquarters in the Shenandoah Valley. He had finished
the work of clearing out the valley by the battle
of Cedar Creek on October 19th, and the Government
wanted to recognize the victory by promoting him to
the rank of major general in the regular army. There
were numerous volunteer officers who were also officers
in the regular army, and it was regarded as a considerable
distinction. The appointment was made, and then,
as an additional compliment to General Sheridan, instead
of sending him the commission by an ordinary
officer from the department, Mr. Stanton decided that
I would better deliver it. I started on October 22d,
going by special train to Harper's Ferry, whither I telegraphed
for an escort to be ready for me. I was delayed
so that I did not get started from Harper's Ferry
until about five o'clock on the morning of October 23d.
It was a distance of about fifty miles to Sheridan, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</a></span>
by riding all day I got there about eleven o'clock at
night. Sheridan had gone to bed, but in time of war
one never delays in carrying out orders, whatever their
nature. The general was awakened, and soon was out
of his tent; and there, by the flare of an army torch and
in the presence of a few sleepy aides-de-camp and of my
own tired escort, I presented to Sheridan his commission
as major general in the regular army.</p>

<p>Sheridan did not say much in reply to my little
speech, nor could he have been expected to under the
circumstances, though he showed lively satisfaction in
the Government's appreciation of his services, and spoke
most heartily, I remember, of the manner in which the
administration had always supported him.</p>

<p>The morning after this little ceremony, when we
had finished our breakfast, the general asked me if I
would not like to ride through the army with him. It
was exactly what I did want to do, and we were soon
on horseback and off, accompanied by four of his officers.
We rode through the entire army that morning,
dismounting now and then to give me an opportunity
to pay my respects to several officers whom I knew.
I was struck, in riding through the lines, by the universal
demonstration of personal affection for Sheridan.
Everybody seemed personally to be attached to him.
He was like the most popular man after an election&mdash;the
whole force everywhere honored him. Finally I
said to the general: "I wish you would explain one
thing to me. Here I find all these people of every rank&mdash;generals,
sergeants, corporals, and private soldiers; in
fact, everybody&mdash;manifesting a personal affection for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</a></span>
you that I have never seen in any other army, not even
in the Army of the Tennessee for Grant. I have never
seen anything like it. Tell me what is the reason?"</p>

<p>"Mr. Dana," said he, "I long ago made up my mind
that it was not a good plan to fight battles with paper
orders&mdash;that is, for the commander to stand on a hill
in the rear and send his aides-de-camp with written orders
to the different commanders. My practice has
always been to fight in the front rank."</p>

<p>"Well," said I, "General, that is dangerous; in the
front rank a man is much more liable to be killed than
he is in the rear."</p>

<p>"Well," said he, "I know that there is a certain
risk in it; but, in my judgment, the advantage is much
greater than the risk, and I have come to the conclusion
that that is the right thing to do. That is the reason
the men like me. They know that when the hard
pinch comes I am exposed just as much as any of
them."</p>

<p>"But are you never afraid?" I asked.</p>

<p>"If I was I should not be ashamed of it," he said.
"If I should follow my natural impulse, I should run
away always at the beginning of the danger; the men
who say they are never afraid in a battle do not tell the
truth."</p>

<p>I talked a great deal with Sheridan and his officers
while at Cedar Creek on the condition of the valley,
and as to what should be done to hold it. The active
campaign seemed to be over in this region for that
year. The enemy were so decidedly beaten and scattered,
and driven so far to the south, that they could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</a></span>
scarcely be expected to collect their forces for another
attempt during the season. Besides, the devastation
of the valley, extending as it did for a distance of about
one hundred miles, rendered it almost impossible that
either the Confederates or our own forces should make
a new campaign in that territory. It looked to me as
if, when Sheridan had completed the same process down
the valley to the vicinity of the Potomac, and when
the stores of forage which were yet to be found were
all destroyed or removed, the difficulty of any new
offensive operations on either side would be greatly
increased.</p>

<p>The key to the Shenandoah Valley was, in Sheridan's
judgment, the line of the Opequan Creek, which
was rather a deep ca√±on than an ordinary watercourse.
Sheridan's idea I understood to be to fall back to the
proper defensive point upon that creek, and there to
construct fortifications which would effectually cover
the approach to the Potomac.</p>

<p>I left Sheridan at Cedar Creek, and went back to
Washington by way of Manassas Gap.</p>

<p>All through the fall of 1864 and the following winter
I remained in Washington, very much occupied with
the regular routine business of the department and various
matters of incidental interest. Some of these incidents
I shall group together here, without strict regard
to sequence.</p>

<p>An important part of the work of the department
was in relation to the railroads and to railroad transportation.
Sometimes it was a whole army corps to
be moved. At another time the demand would be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</a></span>
equally sudden and urgent, if less vital to the Union
cause. I remember particularly the great turkey movement
in November of that year. The presidential election
was hardly over before the people of the North
began to prepare Thanksgiving boxes for the army.
George Bliss, Jr., of New York, telegraphed me, on
November 16th, that they had twenty thousand turkeys
ready in that city to send to the front; and the next day,
fearing, I suppose, that that wasn't enough, he wired:
"It would be a very great convenience in our turkey
business if I could know definitely the approximate
number of men in each of armies of Potomac, James,
and Shenandoah, respectively."</p>

<p>From Philadelphia I received a message asking for
transportation to Sheridan's army for "boxes containing
four thousand turkeys, and Heaven knows what
else, as a Thanksgiving dinner for the brave fellows."
And so it was from all over the country. The North
not only poured out food and clothing generously for
our own men, but, when Savannah was entered by Sherman,
great quantities of provisions were sent there for
gratuitous distribution, and when Charleston fell every
effort was made to relieve destitution.</p>

<p>A couple of months later, in January, 1865, a piece
of work not so different from the "turkey business,"
but on a rather larger scale, fell to me. This was the
transfer of the Twenty-third Army Corps, commanded
by Major-General John M. Schofield, from its position
on the Tennessee River to Chesapeake Bay. There
being no prospect of a winter campaign under Thomas,
Grant had ordered the corps transferred as quickly as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</a></span>
possible, and Mr. Stanton turned over the direction
to me. On January 10th I telegraphed to Grant at
City Point the plan to be followed. This, briefly, was
to send Colonel Lewis B. Parsons, chief of railroad and
river transportation, to the West to take charge of the
corps. I proposed to move the whole body by boats to
Parkersburg if navigation allowed, and thence by the
Baltimore and Ohio Railroad to Annapolis, for I remembered
well with what promptness and success
Hooker's forces, the Eleventh and Twelfth Corps, were
moved into Tennessee in 1863 by that road. A capital
advantage of that line was that it avoided all large towns&mdash;and
the temptations of large towns were bad for the
soldiers in transit. If the Ohio River should be frozen,
I proposed to move the corps by rail from Cairo, Evansville,
and Jeffersonville to Parkersburg or Bellaire, according
to circumstances.</p>

<p>Commanders in the vicinity of the corps were advised
of the change, and ordered to prepare steamboats
and transports. Loyal officers of railroads were requested
to meet Colonel Parsons at given points to
arrange for the concentration of rolling stock in case
the river could not be used. Liquor shops were ordered
closed along the route, and arrangements were made
for the comfort of the troops by supplying to them,
as often as once in every hundred miles of travel, an
abundance of hot coffee in addition to their rations.</p>

<p>Colonel Parsons proceeded at once to Louisville,
where he arrived on the 13th. By the morning of the
18th he had started the first division from the mouth
of the Tennessee up the Ohio, and had transportation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</a></span>
ready for the rest of the corps. He then hurried to
Cincinnati, where, as the river was too full of ice to
permit a further transfer by water, he loaded about
three thousand men on the cars waiting there and started
them eastward. The rest of the corps rapidly followed.
In spite of fogs and ice on the river, and broken rails
and machinery on the railroads, the entire army corps
was encamped on the banks of the Potomac on February
2d.</p>

<p>The distance over which the corps was transported
was nearly fourteen hundred miles, about equally divided
between land and water. The average time of
transportation, from the embarkment on the Tennessee
to the arrival on the banks of the Potomac, did not
exceed eleven days; and what was still more important
was the fact that during the whole movement not a
single accident happened causing loss of life, limb, or
property, except in a single instance where a soldier
improperly jumped from the car, under apprehension
of danger, and thus lost his life. Had he remained quiet,
he would have been as safe as were his comrades of the
same car.</p>

<p>Much of the success of the movement was due to
the hearty co-operation of J. W. Garrett, president of
the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad. Colonel Parsons
did not say too much when he wrote, in his report of
the transfer of Schofield's troops:</p>

<div class='letter'>

<p>The circumstances, I think, render it not invidious
that I should especially refer to the management of
the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad, where indomitable
will, energy, and superior ability have been so often
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</a></span>and so conspicuously manifested, and where such invaluable
service has been rendered to the Government;
a road nearly four hundred miles in length, so
often broken and apparently destroyed, so constantly
subjected to rebel incursions, that, had it been under
ordinary management, it would long since have ceased
operation; yet, notwithstanding all the difficulties of
the severe winter season, the great disorganization of
employees necessarily incident to a road thus situated,
its most extraordinary curves, grades, bridges, tunnels,
and the mountain heights it scales, it has moved this
large force in the shortest possible time, with almost
the exactness and regularity of ordinary passenger
trains, and with a freedom from accident that, I think,
has seldom, if ever, been paralleled.</p></div>

<p>At the end of the war, when the department's energies
were devoted to getting itself as quickly and as
thoroughly as possible upon a peace footing, it fell to
me to examine the condition of the numerous railroads
which the Government had seized and used in the time
of active military operations, and to recommend what
was to be done with them. This readjustment was not
the least difficult of the complicated questions of disarmament.
The Government had spent millions of dollars
on improvements to some of these military railroads
while operating them. My report was not finished
till late in May, 1865, and as it contains much
out-of-the-way information on the subject, and has
never been published, I introduce it here in full:</p>

<div class='letter'>

<p class='nr5right'>
<span class="smcap">Washington City</span>, <i class='date'>May 29, 1865</i>.</p>

<p>Hon. <span class="smcap">Edwin M. Stanton</span>, Secretary of War.
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir</span>: I have the honor to report that I have examined
the subject of the disposition to be made of the
railroads in the States lately in rebellion, referred to me
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</a></span>in connection with the report of the quartermaster general,
and the rules which he has recommended to be
established. The second rule proposed by the quartermaster
general provides that no charge shall be made
against a railroad for expense of materials or expense
of operation while it has been in the hands of the military
authorities of the United States. In other words,
he proposes to restore every railroad to its claimants
without any special consideration from them for any
improvements which the United States may have made
upon it.</p>

<p>It is true in his fourth rule he includes past expenditures
of defense and repair as an equivalent for the
use of the road while it has been in the public service,
but in many cases this does not appear to me to be sufficient.
Our expenditures upon some of these roads
have been very heavy. For instance, we have added to
the value of the road from Nashville to Chattanooga
at least a million and a half dollars. When that road
was recaptured from the public enemy it was in a very
bad state of repair. Its embankments were in many
places partially washed away, its iron was what is known
as the U rail, and was laid in the defective old-fashioned
manner, upon longitudinal sleepers, without cross ties.
These sleepers were also in a state of partial decay, so
that trains could not be run with speed or safety. All
these defects have now been remedied. The roadbed
has been placed in first-rate condition. The iron is now
a heavy T rail, laid in new iron the entire length of the
line. Extensive repair shops have also been erected,
well furnished with the necessary tools and machinery.
I do not conceive that it would be just or advisable to
restore this road, with its improved tracks and these
costly shops, without any equivalent for the great value
of these improvements other than the use we have made
of it since its recapture. The fact that we have replaced
the heavy and expensive bridges over Elk, Duck, and
Tennessee Rivers, and over Running Water Creek,
should also not be forgotten in deciding this question.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</a></span></p>
<p>The above general remarks are also applicable to
that portion of the Orange and Alexandria Railroad
between the Potomac and the Rapidan. Very extensive
repair shops have been erected at Alexandria, and
furnished with costly machinery for the use of the road,
and I understand that the iron and the roadbed are
now much better than when the Government began to
use it.</p>

<p>The same is still more the case with the road between
City Point and Petersburg. When that road was
recaptured from the public enemy not only was the
roadbed a good deal washed away and damaged, but
neither rails nor sound ties were left upon it. Now
it is in the best possible condition. Can any one contend
that it ought to be restored to its claimants without
charge for the new ties and iron?</p>

<p>The case of the railroad from Harper's Ferry to
Winchester is no less striking. It was a very poor
road before the war, and was early demolished by the
rebels. Not a pound of iron, not a sound tie, was to
be found upon the line when we began its reconstruction
in December last. We have spent about five hundred
thousand dollars in bringing it to its present condition,
and I have no doubt our improvements could be
sold for that sum to the Baltimore and Ohio Company
should they obtain the title to the roadbed from the
proper authorities of Virginia. Why, then, should we
give them up for nothing?</p>

<p>On the Morehead City and Goldsboro' Railroad we
have rebuilt twenty-seven miles of the track, and furnished
it with new iron and laid new ties on many miles
more since February last. These views also hold good,
unless I am misinformed, with regard to the railroad
leading into New Orleans, the Memphis and Little
Rock Railroad, the Memphis and Charleston Railroad,
and the Mobile and Ohio Railroad. They have all
been improved at great expense while in our hands.</p>

<p>In the third rule proposed by the quartermaster
general it is provided that all materials for permanent
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</a></span>way used in the repair and construction of any road,
and all damaged material of this class which may be
left along its route, having been thrown there during
operation of destruction and repair, shall be considered
as part of the road, and given up with it also without
compensation. If this means to give up any new iron
that we have on the line of any road, it seems to me
to concede to the parties to whom the roads are to be
surrendered more than they have a right to claim. For
instance, there is now lying at Alexandria, on the line
of the Orange and Alexandria road, iron sufficient to
lay thirty miles of track. It seems manifest to me that
this iron should not be surrendered to the road without
being paid for. In my judgment it is also advisable to
establish the principle that the Government will not
pay for the damages done any road in the prosecution
of hostilities, any more than it will pay for similar damages
done by the enemy. With these exceptions, the
principles proposed by the quartermaster general appear
to be correct.</p>

<p>In accordance with these observations, I would
recommend that the following rules be determined upon
to govern the settlement of these matters:</p>

<p>1. The United States will, as soon as it can dispense
with military occupation and control of any road
of which the Quartermaster's Department is in charge,
turn it over to the parties asking to receive it who may
appear to have the best claim, and be able to operate
it in such a manner as to secure the speedy movement
of all military stores and troops, the quartermaster general,
upon the advice of the commander of the department,
to determine when this can be done, subject to
the approval of the Secretary of War.</p>

<p>2. Where any State has a loyal board of works, or
other executive officers charged with the supervision
of railroads, such road shall be turned over to such
board of officers rather than to any corporations or private
parties.</p>

<p>3. When any railroad shall be so turned over, a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</a></span>board of appraisers shall be appointed, who shall estimate
and determine the value of any improvements
which may have been made by the United States, either
in the road itself or in its repair shop and permanent
machinery, and the amount of such improvements shall
be a lien upon the road.</p>

<p>4. The parties to whom the road is turned over shall
have the option of purchasing at their value any tools,
iron, or any other materials for permanent way which
have been provided by the United States for the improvement
of the road and have not been used.</p>

<p>5. All other movable property, including rolling
stock of all kinds, the property of the United States, to
be sold at auction, after full public notice, to the highest
bidder.</p>

<p>6. All rolling stock and materials of railroads captured
by the forces of the United States, and not consumed,
destroyed, or permanently fixed elsewhere&mdash;as,
for instance, when captured iron has been laid upon
other roads&mdash;shall be placed at the disposal of the roads
which originally owned them, and shall be given up to
these roads as soon as it can be spared and they appear
by proper agents authorized to receive it.</p>

<p>7. No payment or credit shall be given to any railroad
recaptured from the enemy for its occupation or
use by the United States to take possession of it, but
its capture and restoration shall be considered a sufficient
consideration for all such use; nor shall any indemnity
be paid for injuries done to the property of
any road by the forces of the United States during the
continuance of the war.</p>

<p>8. Roads which have not been operated by the
United States Quartermaster's Department not to be
interfered with unless under military necessity; such
roads to be left in the possession of such persons as
may now have possession, subject only to the removal
of every agent, director, president, superintendent, or
operative who has not taken the oath of allegiance to
the United States.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</a></span></p>
<p>9. When superintendents in actual possession decline
to take the oath, some competent person shall be
appointed as receiver of the road, who will administer
its affairs and account for its receipts to the board of
directors, who may be formally recognized as the legal
and formal board of managers, the receiver to be appointed
by the Treasury Department, as in the case of
abandoned property.</p>

<p>I am, sir, very respectfully, your obedient servant,</p>

</p></div>

<p>These recommendations were carried out partly in
the transfer, which was practically complete by the end
of 1865. The department decided upon a somewhat
more liberal policy than I had thought justifiable. The
roads and bridges were transferred practically in the
same condition as they were in at the time of transfer.
It was believed that this generosity would react favorably
upon the revenue and credit of the nation, and
there is no doubt that it did have a good influence.</p>

<p>During the presidential campaign of 1864, which
resulted in Lincoln's re-election and in the further prosecution
of the war upon the lines of Lincoln's policy,
we were busy in the department arranging for soldiers
to go home to vote, and also for the taking of ballots
in the army. There was a constant succession of telegrams
from all parts of the country requesting that leave
of absence be extended to this or that officer, in order
that his district at home might have the benefit of his
vote and political influence. Furloughs were asked for
private soldiers whose presence in close districts was
deemed of especial importance, and there was a wide<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</a></span>spread
demand that men on detached service and convalescents
in hospitals be sent home.</p>

<p>All the power and influence of the War Department,
then something enormous from the vast expenditure
and extensive relations of the war, was employed to secure
the re-election of Mr. Lincoln. The political struggle
was most intense, and the interest taken in it, both
in the White House and in the War Department, was
almost painful. After the arduous toil of the canvass,
there was naturally a great suspense of feeling until
the result of the voting should be ascertained. On
November 8th, election day, I went over to the War
Department about half past eight o'clock in the evening,
and found the President and Mr. Stanton together
in the Secretary's office. General Eckert, who then had
charge of the telegraph department of the War Office,
was coming in constantly with telegrams containing
election returns. Mr. Stanton would read them, and
the President would look at them and comment upon
them. Presently there came a lull in the returns, and
Mr. Lincoln called me to a place by his side.</p>

<p>"Dana," said he, "have you ever read any of the
writings of Petroleum V. Nasby?"</p>

<p>"No, sir," I said; "I have only looked at some of
them, and they seemed to be quite funny."</p>

<p>"Well," said he, "let me read you a specimen";
and, pulling out a thin yellow-covered pamphlet from
his breast pocket, he began to read aloud. Mr. Stanton
viewed these proceedings with great impatience, as I
could see, but Mr. Lincoln paid no attention to that.
He would read a page or a story, pause to consider a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</a></span>
new election telegram, and then open the book again
and go ahead with a new passage. Finally, Mr. Chase
came in, and presently somebody else, and then the
reading was interrupted.</p>

<p class='p2'>Mr. Stanton went to the door and beckoned me into
the next room. I shall never forget the fire of his indignation
at what seemed to him to be mere nonsense.
The idea that when the safety of the republic was thus
at issue, when the control of an empire was to be determined
by a few figures brought in by the telegraph,
the leader, the man most deeply concerned, not merely
for himself but for his country, could turn aside to read
such balderdash and to laugh at such frivolous jests was,
to his mind, repugnant, even damnable. He could not
understand, apparently, that it was by the relief which
these jests afforded to the strain of mind under which
Lincoln had so long been living, and to the natural
gloom of a melancholy and desponding temperament&mdash;this
was Mr. Lincoln's prevailing characteristic&mdash;that
the safety and sanity of his intelligence were maintained
and preserved.</p>

<p>It was evident to all of us, as the spring of 1865
came on, that the war was drawing to a close. Sherman
was coming northward from his triumphant march
to the sea, and would soon be in communication with
Grant, who, ever since I left him in July, 1864, had
been watching Petersburg and Richmond, where Lee's
army was shut up. At the end of March Grant advanced.
On April 1st Sheridan won the battle of Five
Forks; then on April 2d came the successful assaults
which drove Lee from Petersburg.</p>

<p>On the morning of April 3d, before I had left my
house, Mr. Stanton sent for me to come immediately
to the War Department. When I reached his office,
he told me that Richmond had surrendered, and that
he wanted me to go down at once to report the condition
of affairs. I started as soon as I could get a
steamboat, Roscoe Conkling and my son Paul accompanying
me. We arrived at City Point early on April<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</a></span>
5th. Little was known there of the condition of things
in Richmond. There were but a few officers left at the
place, and those were overwhelmed with work. I had
expected to find the President at City Point, he having
been in the vicinity for several days, but Mr. Lincoln
had gone up to Richmond the day before.</p>

<p>I started up the river immediately, and reached the
town early in the afternoon. I went at once to find
Major-General Godfrey Weitzel, who was in command
of the United States forces. He was at his headquarters,
which were in Jefferson Davis's former residence. I had
heard down the river that Davis had sold his furniture
at auction some days before the evacuation, but I found
when I reached the house that this was a mistake&mdash;the
furniture was all there.</p>

<p>Weitzel told me that he had learned at three o'clock
in the morning of Monday, April 3d, that Richmond
was being evacuated. He had moved forward at daylight,
first taking care to give his men breakfast, in the
expectation that they might have to fight. He met
no opposition, and on entering the city was greeted with
a hearty welcome from the mass of people. The mayor
went out to meet him to surrender the city, but missed
him on the road.</p>

<p>I took a walk around Richmond that day to see
how much the city was injured. The Confederates in
retreating had set it on fire, and the damage done in
that way was enormous; nearly everything between
Main Street and the river, for about three quarters of a
mile, was burned. The custom house and the Spotswood
Hotel were the only important buildings remain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</a></span>ing
in the burned district. The block opposite the
Spotswood, including the Confederate War Department
building, was entirely consumed. The Petersburg
Railroad bridge, and that of the Danville road,
were destroyed. All the enemy's vessels, excepting an
unfinished ram which had her machinery in perfect
order, were burned. The Tredegar Iron Works were
unharmed. Libby Prison and Castle Thunder had also
escaped the fire.</p>

<p>Immediately upon arriving I began to make inquiries
about official papers. I found that the records
and documents of the departments and of Congress
had generally been removed before the evacuation, and
that during the fire the Capitol had been ransacked and
the documents there scattered. In the rooms of the
Secretary of the Senate and of the Military Committee
of the House of Representatives in the State House we
found some papers of importance. They were in various
cases in drawers, and all in great confusion. They were
more or less imperfect and fragmentary. In the State
Engineer's office also there were some boxes of papers
relating to the Confederate works on the Potomac,
around Norfolk, and on the Peninsula. I had all of
these packed for shipment, without attempting to put
them in order, and forwarded at once to Washington.</p>

<p>General Weitzel told me that he had found about
twenty thousand people in Richmond, half of them of
African descent. He said that when President Lincoln
entered the town on the 4th he received a most enthusiastic
reception from the mass of the inhabitants. All
the members of Congress had escaped, and only the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</a></span>
Assistant Secretary of War, Judge John Archibald
Campbell, remained in the fallen capital of the Confederacy.
Most of the newspaper editors had fled, but
the Whig appeared on the 4th as a Union paper, with
the name of its former proprietor at its head. The
night after I arrived the theater opened.</p>

<p>There was much suffering and poverty among the
population, the rich as well as the poor being destitute
of food. Weitzel had decided to issue supplies to all
who would take the oath. In my first message to Mr.
Stanton I spoke of this. He immediately answered:
"Please ascertain from General Weitzel under what authority
he is distributing rations to the people of Richmond,
as I suppose he would not do it without authority;
and direct him to report daily the amount of rations
distributed by his order to persons not belonging
to the military service, and not authorized by law to
receive rations, designating the color of the persons,
their occupation, and sex." Mr. Stanton seemed to be
satisfied when I wired him that Weitzel was working
under General Ord's orders, approved by General Grant,
and that he was paying for the rations by selling captured
property.</p>

<p>The important question which the President had on
his mind when I reached Richmond was how Virginia
could be brought back to the Union. He had already
had an interview with Judge Campbell and other prominent
representatives of the Confederate Government.
All they asked, they said, was an amnesty and a military
convention to cover appearances. Slavery they
admitted to be defunct. The President did not promise<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</a></span>
the amnesty, but he told them he had the pardoning
power, and would save any repentant sinner from hanging.
They assured him that, if amnesty could be offered,
the rebel army would be dissolved and all the
States return.</p>

<p>On the morning of the 7th, five members of the so-called
Virginia Legislature held a meeting to consider
written propositions which the President had handed
to Judge Campbell. The President showed these papers
to me confidentially. They were two in number. One
stated reunion as a <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">sine qua non</i>; the second authorized
General Weitzel to allow members of the body claiming
to be the Legislature of Virginia to meet in Richmond
for the purpose of recalling Virginia's soldiers from the
rebel armies, with safe conduct to them so long as they
did and said nothing hostile to the United States. In
discussing with me these documents, the President remarked
that Sheridan seemed to be getting rebel soldiers
out of the war faster than the Legislature could
think.</p>

<p>The next morning, on April 8th, I was present at
an interesting interview between General Weitzel and
General Shepley, who had been appointed as Military
Governor of Richmond, and a committee of prominent
citizens and members of the Legislature. Various
papers were read by the Virginian representatives, but
they were told plainly that no propositions could be
entertained that involved a recognition of the Confederate
authorities. The committee were also informed
that if they desired to prepare an address to the people,
advising them to abandon hostility to the Government<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</a></span>
at once, and begin to obey the laws of the United States,
they should have every facility for its circulation through
the State, provided, of course, that it met the approval
of the military authorities. The two Union generals
said that if the committee desired to call a convention
of the prominent citizens of the State, with a view to
the restoration of the authority of the United States
Government, they would be allowed to go outside the
lines of Richmond for the purpose of visiting citizens
in different parts of the State and inducing them to take
part in a convention. Safe conduct was promised to
them for themselves and such citizens as they could
persuade to attend the convention. They were also told
that if they were not able to find conveyances for themselves
for the journey into the country, horses would be
loaned to them for that purpose. All this, they were
informed, was not to be considered as in any manner
condoning any offense of which any individual among
them might have been guilty.</p>

<p>Judge Campbell said that he had no wish to take
a prominent part in the proceedings, but that he had
long since made up his mind that the cause of the South
was hopeless. He had written a formal memorial to
Jefferson Davis, immediately after the Hampton Roads
conference, urging him and the Confederate Congress
to take immediate steps to stop the war and restore the
Union. He had deliberately remained in Richmond to
meet the consequences of his acts. He said that if he
could be used in the restoration of peace and order, he
would gladly undertake any labor that might be desired
of him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</a></span></p>

<p>The spirit of the committee seemed to be generally
the same as Judge Campbell's, though none of them
equalled him in ability and clearness of thought and
statement. They were thoroughly conscious that they
were beaten, and sincerely anxious to stop all further
bloodshed and restore peace, law, and order. This
mental condition seemed to me to be very hopeful and
encouraging.</p>

<p>One day, after the meeting of this committee, I was
in the large room downstairs of the Spotswood Hotel
when my name was called, and I turned around to see
Andrew Johnson, the new Vice-President of the United
States. He took me aside and spoke with great earnestness
about the necessity of not taking the Confederates
back without some conditions or without some
punishment. He insisted that their sins had been enormous,
and that if they were let back into the Union
without any punishment the effect would be very bad.
He said they might be very dangerous in the future.
The Vice-President talked to me in this strain for fully
twenty minutes, I should think. It was an impassioned,
earnest speech that he made to me on the subject of
punishing rebels. Finally, when he paused and I got
a chance to reply, I said:</p>

<p>"Why, Mr. Johnson, I have no power in this case.
Your remarks are very striking, very impressive, and
certainly worthy of the most serious consideration, but
it does not seem to me necessary that they should
be addressed to me. They ought to be addressed
to the President and to the members of Congress,
to those who have authority in the case, and who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</a></span>
will finally have to decide this question which you
raise."</p>

<p>"Mr. Dana," said he, "I feel it to be my duty to
say these things to every man whom I meet, whom I
know to have any influence. Any man whose thoughts
are considered by others, or whose judgment is going
to weigh in the case, I must speak to, so that the weight
of opinion in favor of the view of this question which I
offer may possibly become preponderating and decisive."</p>

<p>That was in April. When Mr. Johnson became
President, not long after, he soon came to take entirely
the view which he condemned so earnestly in this conversation
with me.</p>

<p>Toward the end of the first week after we entered
Richmond the question about opening the churches on
Sunday came up. I asked General Weitzel what he was
going to do. He answered that all the places of worship
were to be allowed to open on condition that no disloyalty
should be uttered, and that the Episcopal clergymen
should read the prayer for the President of the
United States. But the next day General Shepley, the
military governor, came to me to ask that the order
might be relaxed so that the clergy should be required
only not to pray for Davis. I declined giving any
orders, having received none from Washington, and said
that Weitzel must act in the matter entirely on his own
judgment. Judge Campbell used all his influence with
Weitzel and Shepley to get them to consent that a loyal
prayer should not be exacted. Weitzel concluded not
to give a positive order; his decision was influenced by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</a></span>
the examples of New Orleans, Norfolk, and Savannah,
where, he said, the requirement had not been at first
enforced. In a greater measure, however, his decision
was the result of the President's verbal direction to him
to "let the people down easy." The churches were all
well filled on Sunday, the ladies especially attending in
great numbers. The sermons were devout and not political,
the city was perfectly quiet, and there was more
security for persons and property than had existed in
Richmond for many months.</p>

<p>On Monday morning the news of Lee's surrender
reached us in Richmond. It produced a deep impression.
Even the most intensely partisan women now
felt that the defeat was perfect and the rebellion finished,
while among the men there was no sentiment
but submission to the power of the nation, and a returning
hope that their individual property might
escape confiscation. They all seemed most keenly alive
to this consideration, and men like General Anderson,
the proprietor of the Tredegar works, were zealous
in their efforts to produce a thorough pacification and
save their possessions.</p>

<p>The next morning I received from Mr. Stanton an
order to proceed to General Grant's headquarters and
furnish from there such details as might be of interest.
It was at this time that I had an interesting talk with
Grant on the condition of Lee's army and about the
men and arms surrendered. He told me that, in the
long private interview which he had with Lee at
Appomattox, the latter said that he should devote
his whole efforts to pacifying the country and bring<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</a></span>ing
the people back to the Union. Lee declared that
he had always been for the Union in his own heart,
and could find no justification for the politicians who
had brought on the war, the origin of which he believed
to have been in the folly of extremists on both sides.
The war, Lee declared, had left him a poor man, with
nothing but what he had upon his person, and his wife
would have to provide for herself until he could find
some employment.</p>

<p>The officers of Lee's army, Grant said, all seemed to
be glad that it was over, and the men still more so than
the officers. All were greatly impressed by the generosity
of the terms finally granted to them, for at the
time of the surrender they were surrounded and escape
was impossible. General Grant thought that these terms
were of great importance toward securing a thorough
peace and undisturbed submission to the Government.</p>

<p class='p2'>I returned to Washington with General Grant,
reaching there the 13th, and taking up my work in
the department at once.</p>

<p>It was one of my duties at this time to receive the
reports of the officers of the secret service in every part
of the country. On the afternoon of the 14th of April&mdash;it
was Good Friday&mdash;I got a telegram from the provost
marshal in Portland, Me., saying: "I have positive information
that Jacob Thompson will pass through Portland
to-night, in order to take a steamer for England.
What are your orders?"</p>

<p>Jacob Thompson, of Mississippi, had been Secretary
of the Interior in President Buchanan's administration.
He was a conspicuous secessionist, and for some time
had been employed in Canada as a semi-diplomatic
agent of the Confederate Government. He had been
organizing all sorts of trouble and getting up raids,
of which the notorious attack on St. Albans, Vt., was
a specimen. I took the telegram and went down and
read it to Mr. Stanton. His order was prompt: "Arrest
him!" But as I was going out of the door he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</a></span>
called to me and said: "No, wait; better go over and
see the President."</p>

<p>At the White House all the work of the day was
over, and I went into the President's business room
without meeting any one. Opening the door, there
seemed to be no one there, but, as I was turning to go
out, Mr. Lincoln called to me from a little side room,
where he was washing his hands:</p>

<p>"Halloo, Dana!" said he. "What is it? What's
up?"</p>

<p>Then I read him the telegram from Portland.</p>

<p>"What does Stanton say?" he asked.</p>

<p>"He says arrest him, but that I should refer the
question to you."</p>

<p>"Well," said the President slowly, wiping his hands,
"no, I rather think not. When you have got an elephant
by the hind leg, and he's trying to run away, it's
best to let him run."</p>

<p>With this direction, I returned to the War Department.</p>

<p>"Well, what says he?" asked Mr. Stanton.</p>

<p>"He says that when you have got an elephant by
the hind leg, and he is trying to run away, it's best to
let him run."</p>

<p>"Oh, stuff!" said Stanton.</p>

<p>That night I was awakened from a sound sleep by
a messenger with the news that Mr. Lincoln had been
shot, and that the Secretary wanted me at a house in
Tenth Street. I found the President with a bullet
wound in the head, lying unconscious, though breathing
heavily, on a bed in a small side room, while all the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</a></span>
members of the Cabinet, and the Chief Justice with
them, were gathered in the adjoining parlor. They
seemed to be almost as much paralyzed as the unconscious
sufferer within the little chamber. The surgeons
said there was no hope. Mr. Stanton alone was
in full activity.</p>

<p>"Sit down here," said he; "I want you."</p>

<p>Then he began and dictated orders, one after another,
which I wrote out and sent swiftly to the telegraph.
All these orders were designed to keep the business
of the Government in full motion until the crisis
should be over. It seemed as if Mr. Stanton thought of
everything, and there was a great deal to be thought
of that night. The extent of the conspiracy was, of
course, unknown, and the horrible beginning which had
been made naturally led us to suspect the worst. The
safety of Washington must be looked after. Commanders
all over the country had to be ordered to take
extra precautions. The people must be notified of the
tragedy. The assassins must be captured. The coolness
and clearheadedness of Mr. Stanton under these
circumstances were most remarkable. I remember that
one of his first telegrams was to General Dix, the military
commander of New York, notifying him of what
had happened. No clearer brief account of the tragedy
exists to-day than this, written scarcely three hours
after the scene in Ford's Theater, on a little stand in the
room where, a few feet away, Mr. Lincoln lay dying.</p>

<p>I remained with Mr. Stanton until perhaps three
o'clock in the morning. Then he said: "That's enough.
Now you may go home."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</a></span></p>

<p>When I left, the President was still alive, breathing
heavily and regularly, though, of course, quite unconscious.
About eight o'clock I was awakened by a rapping
on a lower window. It was Colonel Pelouze, of
the adjutant-general's office, and he said:</p>

<p>"Mr. Dana, the President is dead, and Mr. Stanton
directs you to arrest Jacob Thompson."</p>

<p>The order was sent to Portland, but Thompson
couldn't be found there. He had taken the Canadian
route to Halifax.</p>

<p>The whole machinery of the War Department was
now employed in the effort to secure the murderer of
the President and his accomplices. As soon as I had
recovered from the first shock of Mr. Lincoln's death,
I remembered that in the previous November I had
received from General Dix the following letter:</p>

<div class='letter'>

<p class='nr9right'>
<span class="smcap">Headquarters, Department of the East</span>,</p>
<p class='nr5right'><span class="smcap">New York City</span>, <i class='date'>November 17, 1864</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">C. A. Dana</span>, Esq.
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">My dear Sir</span>: The inclosed was picked up in a
Third Avenue railroad car. I should have thought the
whole thing got up for the Sunday Mercury but for the
genuine letter from St. Louis in a female hand. The
Charles Selby is obviously a manufacture. The party
who dropped the letter was heard to say he would start
for Washington Friday night. He is of medium size,
has black hair and whiskers, but the latter are believed
to be a disguise. He had disappeared before the letter
was picked up and examined.</p>

<p>
Yours truly,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span class="smcap">John A. Dix</span>.
</p></div>

<p>There were two inclosures, this being one of them:</p>

<div class='letter'>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Louis</span>: The time has at last come that we
have all so wished for, and upon you everything de<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</a></span>pends.
As it was decided before you left, we were to
cast lots. Accordingly we did so, and you are to be
the Charlotte Corday of the nineteenth century. When
you remember the fearful, solemn vow that was taken
by us, you will feel there is no drawback&mdash;Abe must die,
and now. You can choose your weapons. The cup,
the knife, the bullet. The cup failed us once, and might
again. Johnson, who will give this, has been like an
enraged demon since the meeting, because it has not
fallen upon him to rid the world of the monster. He
says the blood of his gray-haired father and his noble
brother call upon him for revenge, and revenge he will
have; if he can not wreak it upon the fountain-head,
he will upon some of the bloodthirsty generals. Butler
would suit him. As our plans were all concocted and
well arranged, we separated, and as I am writing&mdash;on
my way to Detroit&mdash;I will only say that all rests upon
you. You know where to find your friends. Your disguises
are so perfect and complete that without one
knew your face no police telegraphic dispatch would
catch you. The English gentleman "Harcourt" must
not act hastily. Remember he has ten days. Strike
for your home, strike for your country; bide your time,
but strike sure. Get introduced, congratulate him,
listen to his stories&mdash;not many more will the brute tell
to earthly friends. Do anything but fail, and meet us
at the appointed place within the fortnight. Inclose
this note, together with one of poor Leenea. I will
give the reason for this when we meet. Return by
Johnson. I wish I could go to you, but duty calls me
to the West; you will probably hear from me in Washington.
Sanders is doing us no good in Canada.</p>

<p>Believe me, your brother in love,</p>

<p class='nr5right'>
<span class="smcap">Charles Selby</span>.
</p></div>

<p>The other was in a woman's handwriting:</p>

<div class='letter'>

<p class='nr5right'>
<span class="smcap">St. Louis</span>, <i class='date'>October 21, 1864</i>.
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dearest Husband</span>: Why do you not come home?
You left me for ten days only, and you now have been
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</a></span>from home more than two weeks. In that long time
only sent me one short note&mdash;a few cold words&mdash;and a
check for money, which I did not require. What has
come over you? Have you forgotten your wife and
child? Baby calls for papa until my heart aches. We
are so lonely without you. I have written to you again
and again, and, as a last resource, yesterday wrote to
Charlie, begging him to see you and tell you to come
home. I am so ill, not able to leave my room; if I was,
I would go to you wherever you were, if in this world.
Mamma says I must not write any more, as I am too
weak. Louis, darling, do not stay away any longer
from your heart-broken wife.</p>

<p class='nr5right'>
<span class="smcap">Leenea.</span>
</p></div>

<p>On reading the letters, I had taken them at once to
President Lincoln. He looked at them, but made no
special remark, and, in fact, seemed to attach very little
importance to them. I left them with him.</p>

<p>I now reminded Mr. Stanton of this circumstance,
and he asked me to go immediately to the White House
and see if I could find the letters. I thought it rather
doubtful, for I knew the President received a great
many communications of a similar nature. However,
I went over, and made a thorough search through his
private desk. He seemed to have attached more importance
to these papers than to others of the kind, for
I found them inclosed in an envelope marked in his own
handwriting, "Assassination." I kept the letters by
me for some time, and then delivered them to Judge
John A. Bingham, special judge advocate in the conspiracy
trial. Judge Bingham seemed to think them of
importance, and asked me to have General Dix send the
finder down to Washington. I wired at once to the
general. He replied that it was a woman who had found<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</a></span>
the letters; that she was keeping a small store in New
York, had several children, was a widow, and had no
servant; that she would have to find some one to take
care of her house, but would be in Washington in a day
or two.</p>

<p>A few days later she came. I was not in town when
Mrs. Hudspeth, as her name proved to be, arrived. I
had gone to Chicago, but from the woman's testimony
on May 12th, I learned that in November, 1864, just
after the presidential election, and on the day, she said,
on which General Butler left New York, she had overheard
a curious conversation between two men in a
Third Avenue car in New York city. She had observed,
when a jolt of the car pushed the hat of one of the men
forward, that he wore false whiskers. She had noticed
that his hand was very beautiful; that he carried a pistol
in his belt; that, judging from his conversation, he was
a young man of education; she heard him say that he
was going to Washington that day. The young men
left the car before she did, and after they had gone her
daughter, who was with her, had picked up a letter from
the floor. Mrs. Hudspeth, thinking it belonged to her,
had carried it from the car. She afterward discovered
the two letters printed above, and took them to General
Scott, who, upon reading them, said they were of great
importance, and sent her to General Dix. When a
photograph of Booth was shown to Mrs. Hudspeth,
she swore that it was the man in disguise whom she
had seen in the car. It was found that Booth was in
New York on the day that she indicated&mdash;that is, the
day General Butler left New York, November 11th&mdash;and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</a></span>
likewise that Booth had gone from there to Washington,
as she had heard this man say he was going
to do. The inference was that the man who had
dropped the letter was Booth.</p>

<p>I was afterward called to the stand, on June 9th,
to testify about the letters. Judge Bingham used these
documents as a link in his chain of evidence showing
that a conspiracy existed "to kill and murder Abraham
Lincoln, William H. Seward, Andrew Johnson,
Ulysses S. Grant, Edwin M. Stanton, and others of his
advisers," and that Booth was a partner in this conspiracy.</p>

<p>I have said that I was in Chicago when Mrs. Hudspeth
gave her testimony. Just after I reached there I
received from Major T. F. Eckert, the head of the military
telegraph, a message saying that the court wanted
me immediately as a witness in the conspiracy trial. I
returned at once, and on the 18th of May appeared in
court. I was wanted that I might testify to the identity
of a key to a secret cipher which I had found on
the 6th of April in Richmond. On that day I had gone
into the office of Mr. Benjamin, the Confederate Secretary
of State; on a shelf, among Mr. Benjamin's books
and other things, I had found a secret cipher key.<a name="FNanchor_E_5" id="FNanchor_E_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_E_5" class="fnanchor">[E]</a>
I saw it was the key to the official Confederate cipher,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</a></span>
and, as we had at times to decipher at the War Department
a good many documents written in that cipher,
it seemed to me of interest, and I brought it away, with
several other interesting documents. When I returned
to Washington I gave it to Major Eckert, who had
charge of cipher dispatches in the War Department.</p>

<p>Now, on the night of Mr. Lincoln's assassination,
Lieutenant W. H. Terry had been sent to the National
Hotel to seize the trunk of J. Wilkes Booth. Among
other things, he had found a paper containing a secret
cipher. When this was given to Major Eckert, he
immediately saw that it was the same as the one which
I had found in Richmond. It was thought that possibly
by means of this evidence it could be shown that
Booth was in communication with the Confederate
Government. I was called back to identify the cipher
key. Major Eckert at the same time presented dispatches
written in the cipher found in Booth's trunk
and sent from Canada to the Confederates. They had
been captured and taken to the War Department, where
copies of them were made. By the key which I had
found these dispatches could be read. These dispatches
indicated plots against the leaders of our Government,
though whether Booth had sent them or not was, of
course, never known.</p>

<p>Throughout the period of the trial I was constantly
receiving and answering messages and letters relative
to the examination or arrest of persons suspected of
being connected with the affair. In most cases neither
the examinations nor arrests led to anything. The
persons had been acquaintances of the known conspira<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</a></span>tors,
or they had been heard to utter disloyal sentiments
and had been reported to the department by zealous
Unionists. It was necessary, however, under the
circumstances, to follow up every clew given us, and,
under Mr. Stanton's directions, I gave attention to all
cases reported.</p>

<p>While the trial was going on in Washington, Jefferson
Davis was captured, on May 10th, near Irwinsville,
Ga., by a detachment of General Wilson's cavalry. Mr.
Davis and his family, with Alexander H. Stephens,
lately Vice-President of the Confederacy, John H.
Reagan, Postmaster General, Clement C. Clay, and
other State prisoners, were sent to Fortress Monroe.
The propeller Clyde, with the party on board, reached
Hampton Roads on May 19th. The next day, May
20th, Mr. Stanton sent for me to come to his office.
He told me where Davis was, and said that he had ordered
General Nelson A. Miles to go to Hampton
Roads to take charge of the prisoners, transferring
them from the Clyde to the fortress. Mr. Stanton was
much concerned lest Davis should commit suicide; he
said that he himself would do so in like circumstances.
"I want you to go to Fortress Monroe," he said, "and
caution General Miles against leaving Davis any possible
method of suicide; tell him to put him in fetters,
if necessary. Davis must be brought to trial; he must
not be allowed to kill himself." Mr. Stanton also told
me that he wanted a representative of the War Department
down there to see what the military was doing,
and to give suggestions and make criticisms and send
him full reports.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</a></span></p>

<p>The status of Jefferson Davis at the time explains
Mr. Stanton's anxiety. It should be remembered that
Davis had not surrendered when the capital of the Confederacy,
Richmond, was captured; neither had he surrendered
with either of the two principal armies under
Lee and Johnston. At that time the whole Confederate
army west of the Mississippi was still at large. To
allow Davis to join this force was only to give the Confederacy
an opportunity to reassemble the forces still
unsurrendered and make another stand for life. Even
more important than this consideration was the fact
that Davis was charged, in President Johnson's proclamation
of May 2, 1865, offering a reward for his capture,
with instigating the assassination of President
Lincoln:</p>

<div class='letter'>

<p><em>Whereas</em>, It appears, from evidence in the Bureau of
Military Justice, that the atrocious murder of the late
President, Abraham Lincoln, and the attempted assassination
of the Hon. W. H. Seward, Secretary of State,
were incited, concerted, and procured by and between
Jefferson Davis, late of Richmond, Va., ... and other
rebels and traitors against the Government of the
United States, harbored in Canada;</p>

<p>Now, therefore, to the end that justice may be done,
I, Andrew Johnson, President of the United States, do
offer and promise for the arrest of said persons or either
of them, within the limits of the United States, so that
they can be brought to trial, the following rewards:
One hundred thousand dollars for the arrest of Jefferson
Davis.... The provost marshal general of the United
States is directed to cause the descriptions of said persons,
with notice of the above rewards, to be published.</p></div>

<p>It was with the above facts in mind that I started
for Hampton Roads on May 20th. On the 22d the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</a></span>
prisoners were transferred from the Clyde to the fortress.
The quarter selected for Davis's prison was a
casemate such as at that time, as well as at the present,
is occupied by officers and their families. In fact, an
officer with his family was moved out of the particular
casemate in which Davis was placed. Any one who
will take the trouble to visit Fortress Monroe can see
the place still, and it certainly has not to-day a gloomy
or forbidding appearance. The whole scene of the
transfer I described in a long telegram which I sent to
Mr. Stanton on the 22d. As it contains my fresh impressions,
and has never before been published, I give
it here in full:</p>

<div class='letter'>

<p class='nr5right'>
From <span class="smcap">Fortress Monroe</span>, 1 <small>P.M.</small>, <i class='date'>May 22, 1865</i>.</p>

<p>Hon. <span class="smcap">E. M. Stanton</span>, Secretary of War:
</p>

<p>The two prisoners have just been placed in their respective
casemates. The sentries are stationed both
within and without their doors. The bars and locks are
fastened, and the regular routine of their imprisonment
has begun. At precisely one o'clock General Miles left
with a tug and a guard from the garrison to go for
Davis and Clay. At half past one the tug left the Clyde
for the fortress. She landed at the engineers' wharf,
and the procession, led by the cavalrymen of Colonel
Pritchard's command, moved through the water battery
on the east front of the fortress and entered by a
postern leading from that battery. The cavalrymen
were followed by General Miles, holding Davis by the
right arm. Next came half a dozen soldiers, and then
Colonel Pritchard with Clay, and last the guard which
Miles took out with him. The arrangements were excellent
and successful, and not a single curious spectator
was any where in sight.</p>

<p>Davis bore himself with a haughty attitude. His
face was somewhat flushed, but his features were com<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</a></span>posed
and his step firm. In Clay's manner there was
less expression of bravado and dramatic determination.
Both were dressed in gray, with drab slouched hats.
Davis wore a thin dark overcoat. His hair and beard
are not so gray as has been reported, and he seems
very much less worn and broken by anxiety and labor
than Mr. Blair reported when he returned from Richmond
last winter. The parties were not informed that
they were not to be removed to the fortress until General
Miles went on board the Clyde, but they had before
learned generally what was their destination.</p>

<p>From his staff officers Davis parted yesterday, shedding
tears at the separation. The same scene has just
been renewed at his parting from Harrison, his private
secretary, who left at one o'clock for Washington. In
leaving his wife and children he exhibited no great emotion,
though she was violently affected. He told her
she would be allowed to see him in the course of the
day. Clay took leave of his wife in private, and he was
not seen by the officers. Both asked to see General
Halleck, but he will not see them.</p>

<p>The arrangements for the security of the prisoners
seem to me as complete as could be desired. Each one
occupies the inner room of a casemate; the window is
heavily barred. A sentry stands within, before each
of the doors leading into the outer room. These doors
are to be grated, but are now secured by bars fastened
on the outside. Two other sentries stand outside of
these doors. An officer is also constantly on duty in
the outer room, whose duty is to see his prisoners every
fifteen minutes. The outer door of all is locked on the
outside, and the key is kept exclusively by the general
officer of the guard. Two sentries are also stationed
without that door, and a strong line of sentries cuts
off all access to the vicinity of the casemates. Another
line is stationed on the top of the parapet overhead, and
a third line is posted across the moats on the counterscarps
opposite the places of confinement. The casemates
on each side and between these occupied by the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</a></span>prisoners are used as guard rooms, and soldiers are always
there. A lamp is constantly kept burning in each
of the rooms. The furniture of each prisoner is a hospital
bed, with iron bedstead, chair and table, and a
movable stool closet. A Bible is allowed to each. I
have not given orders to have them placed in irons, as
General Halleck seemed opposed to it, but General
Miles is instructed to have fetters ready if he thinks
them necessary. The prisoners are to be supplied with
soldiers' rations, cooked by the guard. Their linen will
be issued to them in the same way. I shall be back to-morrow
morning.</p>

<p>Before leaving Fortress Monroe, on May 22d, I
made out for General Miles the order here printed in
facsimile:</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 450px;">
<img src="images/i_286.jpg" width="450" height="467" alt="Handwritten letter" />
<div class="caption"><p>Fortress Monroe May 22, 1865.</p>

<p>Brevet Major General Miles is hereby authorized
and directed to place manacles
and fetters upon the hands and feet
of Jefferson Davis and Clement C.
Clay Jr, whenever he may think
it advisable in order to render
their imprisonment more secure.</p>

<p>By order of the Secretary of War.</p>

<p>C. A. Dana.<br />
A. Secretary of War.</p>
</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</a></span></p>

<p>This order was General Miles's authority for placing
fetters upon Davis a day or two later, when he found
it necessary to change the inner doors of the casemate,
which were light wooden ones, without locks. While
these doors were being changed for grated ones, anklets
were placed on Davis; they did not prevent his
walking, but did prevent any attempt to jump past
the guard, and they also prevented him from running.
As soon as the doors were changed (it required three
days, I think), the anklets were removed. I believe
that every care was taken during Mr. Davis's imprisonment
to remove cause for complaint. Medical officers
were directed to superintend his meals and give him
everything that would excite his appetite. As it was
complained that his quarters in the casemate were unhealthy
and disagreeable, he was, after a few weeks,
transferred to Carroll Hall, a building still occupied
by officers and soldiers. That Davis's health was not
ruined by his imprisonment at Fortress Monroe is
proved by the fact that he came out of the prison in
better condition than when he went in, and that he
lived for twenty years afterward, and died of old age.</p>

<p>I hurried back to Washington from Fortress Monroe
to be present at the grand review of the Armies of
the Potomac and Tennessee, which had been arranged
for May 23d and 24th. I reached the city early in the
morning. The streets were all alive with detachments
of soldiers marching toward Capitol Hill, for it was
there that the parade was to start. Thousands of visitors
were also in the streets.</p>

<p>May 23d was given up to the review of the Army of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</a></span>
the Potomac, and by nine o'clock General Meade and
his staff, at the head of the army, started from the Capitol.
Soon after, I joined the company on the reviewing
officers' stand, in front of the White House, in just
the place which the reviewing stand now occupies on
inauguration days. President Johnson had the central
position on the platform. Upon his right, a seat
was retained for the commander of the corps undergoing
review. As soon as the corps commander with
his staff had passed the grand stand at the head of his
troops, he rode into the grounds of the White House,
dismounted, and came to take his position at the right
of Mr. Johnson, while his troops continued their march.
When all his men had passed, he gave up his place
to the commander of the next corps in the column,
and so on. Next to the corps commanders were seated
Secretary Stanton and Lieutenant-General Grant. On
the left of the President was Postmaster-General Dennison
and, on the first day of the parade, while the Army
of the Potomac passed, Major-General Meade; and on
the second day, while the Army of the Tennessee
passed, Major-General Sherman. The other members
of the Cabinet, many army officers, the assistant secretaries
in the different departments, and a number of
guests invited by the President and the secretaries, were
grouped around these central personages.</p>

<p>On the 24th, when Sherman's army was reviewed,
I sat directly behind Mr. Stanton at the moment when
General Sherman, after having passed the grand stand
at the head of his army, dismounted and came on to
the stand to take his position and review his soldiers.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</a></span>
As he had to pass immediately in front of Secretary
Stanton in order to reach the place assigned to him
on the President's right, I could see him perfectly. I
watched both men closely, for the difficulty between
Stanton and Sherman was at that moment known to
everybody.</p>

<p>The terms upon which Sherman in April had accepted
the surrender of General Joseph E. Johnston's
army in North Carolina went beyond the authority of a
military commander, and touched upon political issues.
It is true that these terms were made conditional upon
the approval of the Government; nevertheless, Mr.
Stanton was deeply indignant at the general for meddling
with matters beyond his jurisdiction. No doubt
his indignation was intensified by his dislike of Sherman.
The two men were antagonistic by nature. Sherman
was an effervescent, mercurial, expansive man,
springing abruptly to an idea, expressing himself enthusiastically
on every subject, and often without reflection.
Stanton could not accommodate himself to
this temperament.</p>

<p>When the memorandum of the agreement between
Johnston and Sherman reached Stanton, he sent Grant
to the general in hot haste, and then published in the
newspapers, which need not have known anything of
the affair, a full account of the unwise compact, and an
indignant repudiation of it by the Government. Naturally
this brought down a furious attack upon Sherman.
All his past services were forgotten for a time, and he
was even called a "traitor." The public quickly saw
the injustice of this attitude; so did most of the men<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[Pg 290]</a></span>
in the Government, and they hastened to appease Sherman,
who was violently incensed over what he called
Stanton's insult. I think he never forgave the Secretary.
When, on May 19th, he reached Washington
with his army, which he had marched northward across
the battlefields of Virginia, he refused to have anything
to do with Stanton, although Grant tried his best to
bring about a reconciliation and the President and
several members of the Cabinet showed him every attention.</p>

<p>I was, of course, curious to see what General Sherman
would do in passing before Mr. Stanton to take
his place on the stand. The general says in his Memoirs
that, as he passed, Stanton offered his hand and he refused
to take it. He is entirely mistaken. I was watching
narrowly. The Secretary made no motion to offer
his hand, or to exchange salutations in any manner.
As the general passed, Mr. Stanton gave him merely
a slight forward motion of his head, equivalent, perhaps,
to a quarter of a bow.</p>

<p class='p2'>In May I had been asked to become the editor of
a new paper to be founded in Chicago, the Republican.
The active promoter was a Mr. Mack, and the concern
was organized with a nominal capital of five hundred
thousand dollars. Only a small part of this was ever
paid up; a large block of the stock was set aside as a
bonus to induce a proper man to become the editor.
Mr. Mack had offered the post to me, and, through the
influence of the Hon. Lyman Trumbull and other prominent
men of Illinois, I was persuaded to accept it. In
deciding on the change, I had arranged to stay in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[Pg 291]</a></span>
Washington until I could finish the routine business
upon which I was then engaged, and until Mr. Stanton
could conveniently spare me. This was not until the
1st of July. On the first day of the month I sent to
the President my resignation as Assistant Secretary of
War, and a few days later I left the capital for Chicago.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_D_4" id="Footnote_D_4"></a><a href="#FNanchor_D_4"><span class="label">[D]</span></a> The feeling of the army toward McCook and Crittenden was afterward
greatly modified. A court of inquiry examined their cases, and
in February, 1864, gave its final finding and opinion. McCook it relieved
entirely from responsibility for the reverse of September 20th,
declaring that the small force at his disposal was inadequate to defend,
against greatly superior numbers, the long line he had taken under
instructions, and adding that, after the line was broken, he had done
everything he could to rally and hold his troops, giving the necessary
orders to his subordinates. General Crittenden's conduct, the court
likewise declared, showed no cause for censure, and he was in no way
responsible for the disaster to the right wing.</p></div>

inches in length and two and one half in diameter, fixed in a frame,
the cylinder having the printed key pasted over it. By shifting the
pointers fixed over the cylinder on the upper portion of the frame,
according to a certain arrangement previously agreed upon, the cipher
letter or dispatch could be deciphered readily. The model was put in
evidence at the trial.</p></div></div>
